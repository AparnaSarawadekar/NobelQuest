She is the current John H. Ware 3rd Endowed Professor in Alzheimer's Research at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and the director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research and co-director of the Marian S. Ware Alzheimer Drug Discovery Program at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.[4] She received the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[1]Early life and education[edit]Lee was born in 1945 in Chongqing, Republic of China, and moved to Hong Kong with her family at age five. She lived with her extended family and studied at a primary school that taught in Chinese. After a year at a secondary school with Chinese as its language of instruction, she switched to a secondary school that taught in English. Her mother, together with most of her relatives, moved to the United States when she was about 11, but she stayed in Hong Kong with one of her brothers and her paternal grandmother.[3]Lee has been learning the piano at the insistence of her mother, who as a result encouraged her to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Lee was eager to leave Hong Kong and explore other countries, and so she began her piano study in 1962.[3] Eventually, her interest in science led her to start a BSc degree in chemistry at the University of London.[5] Two years into her piano program, she decided to fully commit to science, obtaining a BSc in 1967 and then an MSc in biochemistry in 1968 from Imperial College London (which at that time was still a member of the University of London).[3][4]Afterwards, Lee moved to the United States to be closer to her mother, who was living Los Angeles, and pursued her PhD at the University of California, San Francisco under the supervision of Choh Hao Li.[3] She completed it in 1973.[4]Career[edit]Following her PhD, she worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Rudolf Magnus Institute of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands for a year. In 1974, at the invitation of Michael L. Shelanski and Lloyd A. Greene, who were setting up a research group at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, she returned to the United States and became a postdoctoral fellow at the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.[3][6]She then entered the biotechnology sector in 1979, when she became the associate senior research investigator at the Philadelphia-based pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline. Upset about the restrictions in industry, a year later, she returned to academia, joining the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (now Perelman School of Medicine).[3][6] Fearing the transition, she took an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1982 as a back-up plan to be at the pharmaceutical industry, completing two years later.[5][6]Lee became a professor in 1989, and the John H. Ware 3rd Endowed Professor in Alzheimer's Research in 1999.[6]Since 2002, Lee has been the director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.[7]In 2004, the Marian S. Ware Center for Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Program was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and Lee has been directing it since.[8]Research[edit]Lee\u2019s research focuses on the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Together with her late husband John Q. Trojanowski, Lee's studies challenged conventional belief that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is caused by aggregation of amyloid plaques, and pointed to the tau protein as a major player.[5][9][10]The pair first reported in 1988 that the tau protein is a central component of protein aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease (known as paired helical filaments).[11] They also determined that abnormal phosphorylation of the tau protein is responsible for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are aggregates of the tau protein,[12] and found that healthy mice had tau aggregates inside neurons and exhibited Alzheimer's symptoms when injected with pathological tau protein.[13] In a more recent study, they connected the two major types of protein aggregates, amyloid plaques and tau protein aggregates, where the former facilitates tau aggregation in mice.[14]For Parkinson's disease, Lee and Trojanowski reported that another protein, alpha-synuclein, is a major component of Lewy bodies, which are protein aggregates found in neurons of Parkinson's patients.[15] They also discovered a type of chaperone protein can reduce the death of neurons caused by alpha-synuclein built-up,[16] and that similar to the tau protein and Alzheimer's, healthy neurons may take up extracellular alpha-synuclein and become defective in function.[17]Apart from these two relatively well-known neurodegenerative diseases, Lee and Trojanowski also studied frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple system atrophy. In 2004, they associated alpha-synuclein in the brain with multiple system atrophy.[18] Two years later, they showed for the first time the TDP43 protein was abnormally modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitylation in FTLD and ALS.[19]Personal life[edit]Lee met her late husband John Q. Trojanowski in Boston in 1976.[20] At the time she was a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and he was a resident in pathology at Harvard University.[20] They married in 1979.[21] Together they carried out research of Alzheimer's disease at the University of Pennsylvania, where they co-founded the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR) in 1991.[9] They co-directed CNDR until 2002, when Lee became director and Trojanowski the co-director.[7] Trojanowski passed away from a fall and related spinal cord injuries in February 2022.[22][23][24][25]Honors and awards[edit]Potamkin Prize, American Academy of Neurology (1998)[26]Member of the National Academy of Medicine (2005)[27]Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference Lifetime Achievement Awards in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research, Alzheimer's Association (2009)[28]John Scott Medal (2012)[29]Robert J. and Claire Pasarow Foundation Medical Research Award in Psychiatry (2012)[30]Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2013)[31]J.

He is a professor at the University of California, San Francisco.Julius won the 2010 Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine and the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[2][3] He was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Ardem Patapoutian.[4]Early life and education[edit]Julius was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Russia) in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York City,[5] where he attended Abraham Lincoln High School.[6] He earned his undergraduate degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977. He attained his doctorate from University of California, Berkeley in 1984, under joint supervision of Jeremy Thorner and Randy Schekman, where he identified Kex2 as the founding member of furin-like proprotein convertases.[7] In 1989, he completed his post-doctoral training with Richard Axel at Columbia University where he cloned and characterized the serotonin 1c receptor.[8]While at Berkeley and Columbia, Julius became interested in how psilocybin mushrooms and lysergic acid diethylamide work, which led him to look more broadly into how things from nature interact with human receptors.[6]Research career[edit]Nobel Prize workHe started his career as faculty at the University of California, San Francisco in 1989.[9][10] In 1997, Julius's lab cloned and characterized TRPV1 which is the receptor that detects capsaicin, the chemical in chili peppers that makes them hot.[11] They found that TRPV1 also detects noxious heat (thermoception).[11][12] TRPV1 is part of a large family of structurally related TRP (transient receptor potential) cation channels. Animals that lack TRPV1 (using genetic knockouts of the protein) lose sensitivity to noxious heat and capsaicin.[13]Julius's lab has also cloned and characterized TRPM8 (CMR1) and TRPA1, both members of the TRP superfamily. They demonstrated that TRPM8 detects menthol and cooler temperatures[14][15] and TRPA1 detects mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate).[16] These observations suggested that TRP channels detect a range of temperatures and chemicals. David Julius's lab has also made contributions to the study of nociception by discovering toxins that modulate these channels,[17] describing unique adaptations of the channels in diverse species[18] and solving the cryo-EM structures of numerous channels.[19][20]Julius in 2022From 2007\u20132020 Julius served as the editor of the peer-reviewed journal the Annual Review of Physiology.[21][22]Awards[edit]In 2000, Julius was awarded the inaugural Perl-UNC Neuroscience Prize for his work on cloning the capsaicin receptor. In 2010, he won the Shaw Prize for his work identifying the ion channels involved in various aspects of nociception. In 2014, he was honored by Johnson & Johnson with the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research for discovering the molecular basis for pain and thermosensation. In 2017, he won the Gairdner Foundation International Award[23] and the HFSP Nakasone Award.[24] He has also been awarded the 2010 Prince of Asturias Prize for Technical and Scientific Research, the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences,[25] and the 2020 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience (together with Ardem Patapoutian)[26] and the 2020 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award.[27]In 2021, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch.[28]See also[edit]List of Jewish Nobel laureatesReferences[edit]^ Julius Lab at UCSF Mission Bay | David Julius Lab.

Chaudhuri[1]Arthur L. Horwich (born 1951) is an American biologist and Sterling Professor of Genetics and Pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine.[2][3] Horwich has also been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 1990.[4] His research into protein folding uncovered the action of chaperonins, protein complexes that assist the folding of other proteins; Horwich first published this work in 1989.[5][6]For his scientific work Horwich has been awarded the Gairdner International Award (2004), Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (2008), Lasker Award (2011),[7] Shaw Prize (2012), Albany Medical Center Prize (2016), and Breakthrough Prize (2020). He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8][9]Early years[edit]Horwich was born in 1951. He grew up in Oak Park, west of Chicago.[10] In 1969, he entered Brown University as part of a new program that combined the undergraduate degree with medical school.[10] During medical school, Horwich studied fat cell metabolism in the laboratory of John Fain. Horwich received his A.B. in biomedical sciences in 1972 and his M.D. in 1975.[2][4] He graduated as valedictorian of the first class to complete the combined program.[10] Horwich went on to do an internship and residency in pediatrics at Yale University. Midway through, Horwich was not sure about an entirely clinical future. After completing his residency, he joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California for a postdoctoral position in molecular biology and virology.[10] At Salk, he worked in Walter Eckhart's laboratory alongside Tony Hunter and witnessed Hunter's discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation.[10] He credits this time with sharpening his skills as a scientist. He said, Tony taught me the nuts and bolts of thinking about a problem.[10]Research[edit]In 1981, Horwich moved back to New Haven, Connecticut for a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University School of Medicine. He worked in the laboratory of Leon Rosenberg.[11]In 1984, he moved across the hall from Rosenberg's lab to start his own laboratory as an assistant professor in the department of genetics. He still collaborated with members of the Rosenberg laboratory, including Wayne Fenton. As an independent researcher, Horwich asked whether the pathway that imports an enzyme called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) into the mitochondria of mammalian cells also could work in yeast. In 1987, during a genetic screen in yeast, Horwich and his colleagues stumbled across a protein folding function inside mitochondria. In the mutant strain, proteins entered mitochondria from the cytosol normally but then misfolded and aggregated. They named the protein encoded by the affected gene HSP60, Heat shock protein 60, because it has a mass of 60 kDa and is produced in larger quantity in response to heat. Hsp60 is found in an 850 kDa double ring assembly, each ring containing 7 copies of Hsp60. Such assemblies, known as chaperonins, also exist in other cellular compartments and are essential components, mediating protein folding under both heat shock and normal conditions.[12]Since 1987, Horwich and his colleagues have been studying these molecules both in vivo and in vitro, with particular emphasis on the Hsp60 homologue in E. coli known as GroEL. They and others found early on that a chaperonin-mediated folding reaction can be reconstituted in a test tube, and that has enabled structural and functional studies that have begun to explain how chaperonins work.Awards and honors[edit]2001: Hans Neurath Award (Protein Society Award)[13]2003: Elected to the National Academy of Sciences.2004: Canada Gairdner International Award[14]2006: Stein and Moore Award (Protein Society Award)[15]2007: Wiley Prize, awarded jointly with Franz-Ulrich Hartl[16]2008: Rosenstiel Award, awarded jointly with Hartl[17]2008: Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for Biology or Biochemistry, Columbia University; awarded jointly with Hartl[18]2008: Elected to the National Academy of Medicine2011: Massry Prize, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California2011: Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, awarded jointly with Hartl[19]2012: Shaw Prize, awarded jointly with Hartl2014: Honorary Doctorate of Medical Science, Brown University.[20]2016: Albany Medical Center Prize2019: Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize2019: Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research, awarded jointly with Hartl[21]2020: Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[22]2021: Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences2022: Human Frontier Science Program Nakasone Award[23]2023: BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award[24]References[edit]^ Tapan K.

Chen used the scholarship to attend the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he got his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1991.[2][3] During his graduate education, Chen became interested in the biochemical pathway of the protein ubiquitin at a time when less than a dozen laboratories were researching the protein's function in the human body.[4] After graduating, Chen did a year of post-doctoral work with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.[5]Career[edit]Following his post-doctoral work, Chen began working as a research scientist at Baxter Healthcare in Irvine, California. He then spent three years working as a senior scientist at biotech firm ProScript in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he developed assays that helped to identify and improve the cancer treatment Velcade. His time at ProScript allowed Chen to work in molecular biology and drug development and it was while working there that Chen started researching ubiquitin.[3][5] Working with Tom Maniatis of Harvard University in 1996, Chen found that the enzyme kinase had to be activated by ubiquitin in order for the NF-\u03baB signalling process to function properly. He decided pursuing his research into ubiquitin would be more suited for work in academia and left ProScript in 1997 to start a lab at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.[4] He currently holds the George L. MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science and is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[2]Research[edit]Chen's research initially focused on the role of ubiquitin in signaling pathways for the NF-\u03baB protein complex, specifically as it pertains to immune response. At his lab in UT-Southwestern, Chen's group was able to show that ubiquitin marked proteins, marks that could be recognized by other proteins to create a cascade of signals.[4] His research received grant funding from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund in 2002[6] enabling research into how NF-\u03baB initiated immune responses to RNA viruses such as influenza and hepatitis C. This new line of research led to the discovery of MAVS (Mitochondrial Anti-Viral Signaling protein) and the role of mitochondria in antiviral innate immune responses, and the more recent discoveries of the cytosolic DNA sensor, Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS; cGAMP synthase), and a new second messenger, Cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, cGAMP), which play key roles in immune defense as well as autoimmune diseases.Honors and awards[edit]In 2012 Chen was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology,[7] in 2018 the Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences[8] from the National Institutes of Health for his discovery of cGAS and also in 2018 the Ray Wu award from the Chinese Biological Investigators Society. In 2019 Chen received the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for the discovery of the DNA-sensing enzyme cGAS and the pathways by which it activates innate immune responses. He shared this prize with C. Frank Bennett, Adrian R. Krainer, Angelika Amon, and Xiaowei Zhuang.[9] He has also received the Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research and the Edith and Peter O\u2019Donnell Award in Science. In 2023 he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize.[10]Chen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2014.[11]References[edit]^ \u9648\u5fd7\u575a\u5f53\u9009\u7f8e\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u58eb (in Chinese).

He is known for his pioneering work in chaperone-mediated protein folding.Early life and education[edit]Hartl was born in Essen, West Germany in 1957 to an electrical engineer father and a home economics teacher mother. His family moved to a village in northern part of the Black Forest when he was four. He was intrigued with biology since a young age, thanks to his hobby microscopist grandfather and a family friend who was a biology teacher.[2] Hartl specifically became interested in biochemistry in high school after reading James Watson's account of the discovery of the helical structure of DNA, prompting him to study medicine and specialise in biochemistry at Heidelberg University.[2][3] It was during this period when he had his first research experience, studying peroxisomes in rat liver. Hartl completed his MD degree in 1985.[1]Career[edit]After receiving his MD degree, one of the external examiners of Hartl's thesis, Walter Neupert, invited him to join his group at the Institute of Physiological Chemistry of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich as a postdoctoral researcher.[2] Hartl then achieved habilitation in 1990,[1] which is one of the requirements for professorship in Germany.[4][5]In 1989, Hartl spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at William T. Wickner's group at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1991, after obtaining habilitation, he moved to the Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics Program of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also becoming an associate professor at the Cornell University Medical College (now Weill Cornell Medicine). He was promoted to full professor 3 years later.[1]Hartl returned to Germany in 1997 to become one of the Directors of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (MPIB).[1] The Executive Director of MPIB rotates among the Directors every year, and Hartl is the current Executive Director for the year 2023.[6][7]During his time at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Hartl was a William E. Snee Chair and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator (1994-1997).[8]Research[edit]Hartl was known for his discovery of chaperone-mediated protein folding, made together with Arthur L. Horwich. Protein folding is the process where proteins attain their three-dimensional shapes required to be functional.[9] His research on chaperones began during his time at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Soon after he arrived at Munich in 1985, the scientific field confirmed that proteins inside cells had to unfold before and crossing the mitochondrial membrane to enter mitochondria and then refold afterwards, and that heat shock proteins interacted with proteins before they crossed the mitochondrial or the cell membrane.[10] This made the mitochondria a nice model to study protein folding. However, the long-held belief was that proteins fold spontaneously.[11]Walter Neupert, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich professor under Hartl was working, introduced Hartl to Arthur L. Horwich. Using a mutant strain of yeast that could import a certain protein (ornithine transcarbamylase) into the mitochondria but the protein could not fold or become functional once inside the mitochondria. They found the gene mutated in this mutant strain was identical to a previously discovered gene, HSP60.[12] The HSP60 protein, encoded by the HSP60 gene, belongs to a family of chaperones called chaperonin.Next, Hartl and Horwich investigated how the HSP60 protein helped proteins fold. They looked at another protein, dihydrofolate reductase, in Neurospora crassa, a fungus species, and found ATP, the energy currency in cells, is required for the HSP60 protein helping other proteins fold. Their finding showed HSP60-mediated protein folding is dependent on energy.[13]Hartl continued studying chaperones and protein folding after moving to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, focusing on the mechanism by which chaperones helping other proteins fold. He turned to the E. coli counterpart of the eukaryotic HSP60 protein, known as GroEL, and its helper protein GroES. His group showed chaperone-mediated folding actually consisted of a series of steps, and that multiple chaperones passed off partially folded proteins from one to the next.[14] His group also found GroEL and GroES together formed a cage inside which the target protein was trapped and folded.[15][16]More recently, Hartl's work expanded to proteostasis, which a cell's regulation of protein biosynthesis, protein folding, protein trafficking, and protein degradation, and how abnormalities in proteostasis can cause protein aggregation and diseases.[17][18]Scholia has an author profile for Franz-Ulrich Hartl.Personal life[edit]Hartl is married to Manajit Hayer-Hartl, whom he met in 1986 at a molecular biology summer school on a Greek island. Hayer-Hartl is currently a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry[19] and a close collaborator of Hartl since 1991.[10] She was awarded the ASBMB-Merck Award in 2021.[20]Honours and awards[edit]1998 - Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization[21]1999 - Academy Award of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities[22]2000 - International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[23]2002 - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize[24]2002 - Member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina[25]2004 - Member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences[26]2004 - Canada Gairdner International Award[27]2005 - Ernst Jung Prize for Medicine[28]2006 - Stein and Moore Award, Protein Society[29]2006 - K\u00f6rber European Science Prize[30]2007 - Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences[31]2007 - Lewis S.

Friedman (born July 20, 1954) is a molecular geneticist at New York City's Rockefeller University and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His discovery of the hormone leptin and its role in regulating body weight has had a major role in the area of human obesity.[1]Friedman is a physician scientist studying the genetic mechanisms that regulate body weight.  His research on various aspects of obesity received national attention in late 1994, when it was announced that he and his colleagues had isolated the mouse ob gene and its human homologue.  They subsequently found that injections of the encoded protein, leptin, decreases body weight of mice by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure.  Current research is aimed at understanding the genetic basis of obesity in human and the mechanisms by which leptin transmits its weight-reducing signal.Education[edit]Friedman was born in Orlando, Florida on July 20, 1954, and grew up in North Woodmere, New York, graduating from Hewlett High School in the Class of 1971.[2]  As a young man he aspired to becoming a physician. He entered a six-year medical program out of high school and received his M.D. at the age of 22.  But after a year-long fellowship working in the laboratory of Mary Jane Kreek, he fell in love with the science life. As a doctor, you're trained to absorb the facts you're given and accept them, says Friedman. Science is almost the opposite.  It's a frontier of discovery that's always moving.  And I decided I wanted to do research.  Friedman started his affiliation with the Rockefeller University in 1980,[3] where he was awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1986. Friedman received a BS from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1973 and M.D. degree from Albany Medical College in 1977 and completed a medical residency at Albany Medical College in 1980.[4] From 1980 to 1981, he also served as a postgraduate fellow at Cornell University Medical College.[5]Career and research[edit]Friedman was appointed Assistant Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Rockefeller University in 1986, promoted to Associate Investigator in 1991, and Investigator in 1996 and received the Marilyn M. Simpson professorship in 1998.When Friedman started his own laboratory at The Rockefeller University, he turned his attention to the question of weight regulation. Working with a special strain of mice, he set out to identify the hormone that normal animals use to control their appetite - a molecule that was missing in the plump rodents.  After eight years\u2014on May 8, 1994, at 5:30\u00a0a.m.\u2014he found what he was looking for: evidence that he'd located the gene that produces the hormone he later dubbed leptin, after the Greek word for thin (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 leptos).[4]  It was astonishingly beautiful, he says of the x-ray film that nailed the gene, a piece of data that now hangs on his office wall.[citation needed]Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that energy balance in animals and humans is tightly controlled.[citation needed]  With the identification of leptin and its receptors by Friedman's laboratory, two of the molecular components of a system that maintains constant weight were identified.  Leptin is a hormone secreted by the adipose (fat) tissue in proportion to its mass that in turn modulates food intake relative to energy expenditure.  Increased fat mass increases leptin levels, which in turn reduces body weight; decreased fat mass leads to a decrease in leptin] levels and an increase in body weight.[citation needed]  By this mechanism, weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range.  Defects in the leptin gene are associated with severe obesity in animals and in humans.  Leptin acts on sets of neurons in brain centers that control energy balance.[citation needed]  Leptin also plays a general role in regulating many of the physiologic responses that are observed with changes in nutritional state, with clear effects on female reproduction, immune function and the function of many other hormones, including insulin.[citation needed]Leptin feeds into the circuit of neurons in the brain that controls eating and energy expenditure.[citation needed]  When an animal loses weight, leptin concentrations fall.  This dip in leptin levels instructs the body to search for food.[citation needed]  In studies of obese mice, Friedman has found that leptin actually restructures the brain, rewiring the neural circuit that controls feeding.[citation needed] The hormone reinforces the nerve cells that encourage the body to slenderize and prunes the neurons that compel eating.[citation needed]Friedman has published over one hundred and fifty publications and over ten book chapters.He is also involved in the research [6] related to the 1st inbred rat model of obesity [7] and aging,[8] also known as WNIN/Ob obese rats developed in National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India.Awards and honors[edit]Friedman's work in the area of obesity and the leptin gene has led to Friedman receiving many prestigious awards: 1994 and 1996 Time Magazines's Best of Science section1995 Popular Science's Best of Science Award1996 Heinrich Wieland Prize1997 Jacobaeus Prize1999 Steven C.

She received a 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for developing super-resolution imaging techniques that get past the diffraction limits of traditional light microscopes, allowing scientists to visualize small structures within living cells.[8] She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019 and was awarded a Vilcek Foundation Prize in Biomedical Science in 2020.[9]Early life and education[edit]Zhuang's father Zhuang Lixian (\u5e84\u793c\u8d24)[10] and mother Zhu Renzhi (\u6731\u4ec1\u829d) are both professors at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).[11][12][13]Zhuang graduated from the USTC with a B.S. in Physics in 1991. She obtained her Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and conducted her thesis research under the supervision of Dr. Yuen-Ron Shen. In 1997-2001, she was a Chodorow Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Steven Chu at Stanford University. She started her faculty position in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and the Department of Physics at Harvard University in 2001 and was promoted to full professor in 2006.[14]She was named a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator in 2005.[14]Research[edit]Zhuang's laboratory invented Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), a single-molecule-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy method.[5] The Zhuang laboratory demonstrated three-dimensional super-resolution imaging with STORM.[7] The Zhuang laboratory also discovered several photoswitchable dye molecules[6][15][16] that enabled STORM imaging and demonstrated live-cell STORM imaging.[16][17]Using STORM, Zhuang and colleagues have studied a variety of biological systems, ranging from single-cell organisms to complex brain tissues. These studies led to the discovery of novel cellular structures, such as the periodic membrane skeletons in the axons of neurons[18][19] and provided insights into many other cellular structures.[20][21][22]The Zhuang laboratory invented a single-cell transcriptome imaging method, MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization), which allows numerous RNA species to be imaged and quantified in single cells in their native context.[23] Zhuang and colleagues used single-molecule FRET to study biomolecules and molecular complexes[24][25][26][27][28] and developed single-virus tracking methods to study virus-cell interactions.[29][30][31]Honors and awards[edit]2022: Heinrich Wieland Prize[32]2021: Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences2020: Vilcek Foundation Prize in Biomedical Science[9]2019: Pearl Meister Greengard Prize[33]2019: NAS Award for Scientific Discovery[34]2019: Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[14]2018: Dr. H.P.

KirschnerOther\u00a0academic advisorsWilliam RutterDon W. Cleveland (born 1950 in Waynesville, MO) is an American cancer biologist and neurobiologist.Cleveland is currently the Department Chair of Cellular and Molecular Medicine[1] and Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Neurosciences[2] at the University of California at San Diego, and Head, Laboratory for Cell Biology at the San Diego branch of Ludwig Cancer Research.[3]Biography[edit]Cleveland grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  He earned a B.S. in physics in 1972 from New Mexico State University, and graduated as the valedictorian for the College of Arts and Sciences.[3]Cleveland started graduate school at Princeton University in 1972, switching mid-year into biochemistry. He worked with Marc Kirschner and graduated with a Ph.D. in 1977. Cleveland's doctoral dissertation was titled Purification and properties of tau, a microtubule associated protein which induces assembly of microtubules from purified tubulin.[4] As a graduate student, Cleveland provided the initial identification and characterization of tau, showing it to have characteristics of a natively unfolded protein.[5] Tau is now recognized to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease and to be the basis for chronic brain injury.[6] He also developed and published a peptide fingerprinting technique[7] that was so popular that it became a citation classic [8] Cleveland did postdoctoral work with William J. Rutter at the University of California at San Francisco from 1978 to 1981. Cleveland was the first to clone tubulin[9][10] actin and keratin[11]From 1981 through 1995, Cleveland was on the faculty of the Department of Biological Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In 1995, he accepted a position at the San Diego Branch of Ludwig Cancer Research at the University of California at San Diego. Since 2008, he has been Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.Contributions to Science[edit]Cleveland has made pioneering discoveries of the mechanisms of chromosome movement and cell-cycle control during normal cellular division, as well as of the principles of neuronal cell development and their relationship to the defects that contribute to inherited neurodegenerative disease.[12] Cleveland's research looks at the molecular genetics of axonal growth and motor neuron disease and the cell biology of mammalian chromosome movement.[13]Most recently, his research has achieved a significant breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, an inherited and degenerative brain disorder for which there is no cure. A one-time injection of a new DNA-based drug treatment - known as ASO (short for antisense oligonucleotide) - blocked the activity of the gene whose mutation causes the disease. A single treatment silenced the mutated gene responsible for the disease, slowing and partially reversing progression of the fatal neurodegenerative disorder in animal models.[14] This drug, called IONIS-HTTRx, was developed by scientists at Ionis Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with partners CHDI Foundation, Roche Pharmaceuticals and academic collaborators at University of California, San Diego and is now in a Phase 1/2a clinical study.[15]Books[edit]Cell and Molecular Biology of the Cytoskeleton: Molecular Mechanisms Controlling Tubulin SynthesisEdited by Jerry W.

Here he worked on the cell cycle alongside Paul Nurse[3] and his PhD thesis focused on the control of DNA replication in fission yeast.[2] In Mitchison's lab he made substantial contributions to the study of the cell cycle in fission yeast isolating and characterising cell cycle mutants and the first identification of a gene product (DNA ligase) in these mutants.[11]Career and research[edit]Kim Nasmyth explaining loop extrusion with a climbing ropeThe cohesin complex entrapping sister DNAsNasmyth joined Ben Hall's lab in Seattle as a postdoctoral researcher where he developed ways of cloning genes by complementation in yeast and, in collaboration with Steve Reed, cloned the CDC28 gene from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[3]As a group leader in Cambridge Nasmyth became interested in the phenomenon of mating-type switching in yeast. Together with Kelly Tatchell he cloned the S. cerevisiae mating-type locus and found, surprisingly, that 'silent' copies of the mating-type genes including their promoters are maintained in the yeast chromosome. This represented the first case where the position of a gene in the chromosome had demonstrable biological significance, and prompted Nasmyth to abandon work on the cell cycle for a time and concentrate instead on studying gene silencing.[3] He was one of the first to demonstrate that gene expression can be regulated through specific control elements which are distant from the start of transcription.[11]Max Birnstiel invited Nasmyth to join him at the then newly founded Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria, where he was director. Nasmyth became one of the first three senior group leaders that Birnstiel recruited in 1986.[12] At the IMP, Nasmyth changed his focus from gene silencing back to cell cycle control. In the mid-1990s Nasmyth co-discovered the APC/C and showed that its activity induces chromosome segregation.[13] Using temperature-sensitive mutants of the APC/C he found several genes which are required for sister chromatid cohesion[14] which we now know encode subunits of the cohesin complex. Nasmyth has since shown that cohesin forms a ring,[15] that sister chromatids are held together within this ring[16] and that they are released by cleavage of cohesin by separase.[17] Following Max Birnstiel's retirement, Nasmyth became scientific director of the IMP in 1997.[18]In 2006, Nasmyth left the IMP to become head of the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Oxford, a post he held until 2011. Nasmyth continues to head a research group at this department. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.[19][20][21] His research has been funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Wellcome Trust, and Cancer Research UK.[22][23][24][25] He plans to retire from research in 2022.[24]Awards and honours[edit]Nasmyth has also been awarded the following:1985 Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization1989 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society[6]1995 FEBS Silver Medal [26]1996 Unilever Science prize [26]1997 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine[27]1999 Wittgenstein-Preis[28]1999 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[26]2002 Croonian lecture/Medal of the Royal Society [26]2003 Boveri award for Molecular Cancer Genetics [26]2007 Gairdner Foundation International Award[26]2009 Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci)[29]2018 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[30]Personal life[edit]Nasmyth married Anna Dowson, daughter of Sir Philip Dowson, in 1982[31] and has two daughters.[4] His younger brother is furniture designer, Luke Hughes.[32] He enjoys skiing and climbing,[7] a hobby to which he attributes his theory of how cohesin works.[33][34] He also co-owns a vineyard in the south of France.[35] Nasmyth held a large number of shares in his fathers billion dollar company Argus Media until its purchase by General Atlantic in 2016.[36][37] In 2014 he was appointed director of Badger Lane Management company.[5] During his time in Vienna, Nasmyth became Austrian citizen.[38]References[edit]Scholia has an author profile for Kim Nasmyth.^ Louis-Jeantet Prize^ a b Nasmyth, Kim (1977).

Amon's research centered on how chromosomes are regulated, duplicated, and partitioned in the cell cycle.  Amon was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.Early life[edit]Amon was born and raised in Vienna, Austria.[10]  She displayed an early interest in plant and animal biology as a child, keeping a notebook full of newspaper clippings, and was motivated to study biology after learning about Mendelian genetics and seeing time-lapse micrographs of the division of plant cells in middle school.[10][12]Amon received an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Vienna.[10]  She continued her doctoral work there beginning in 1989 under a newly hired Kim Nasmyth at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), receiving a PhD in 1993.[10]  Amon left Austria for the United States in 1994, joining the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a postdoctoral researcher.[10]  She was named a Whitehead Fellow in 1996, which allowed her to start her own laboratory at the Institute.[10][12]Career[edit]Amon's independent work at the Whitehead Institute led directly to her securing a faculty appointment at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT in 1999,[10] the same year she received the Presidential Early Career Award and was named a Howard S. and Linda B. Stern Career Development Assistant Professor.[13]  Amon became an associate investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2000,[14] and was promoted to full professor at MIT in 2007; she had earlier achieved tenure as an assistant professor.[15]Amon was listed as a member of the Editorial Board for Current Biology in 2016,[16] but no longer appears in this position as of 2019.[17]  She served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) from 2009 to 2019.[18]Amon was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017, by which time she had been named the Kathleen and Curtis Marble Professor of Cancer Research at MIT.[19]  She was conferred the Vilcek Prize two years later, in recognition of her as one who had made extraordinary contributions to their fields while being a foreign-born researcher in the United States.[10]Personal life[edit]Amon was married to Johannes Weis.  Together, they had two daughters (Theresa and Clara).[12][20]  She died on October 29, 2020.  She was 53, and suffered from ovarian cancer in the two-and-a-half years leading up to her death.[20]Research[edit]This biography of a living person relies too much on references to primary sources.

More specifically, her research examines the regulation of exit from mitosis, the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, and effects of aneuploidy on normal physiology and tumorigenesis.As a student under Nasmyth, Amon made significant discoveries related to the biosynthesis and breakdown of cyclins during the cell cycle.[10]  More specifically, she demonstrated that CDC28 protein kinase is not required for the metaphase to anaphase transition and CLB2 proteolysis continues until reactivation of CDC28 toward the end of G1.[21][22]During her time as a post-doctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute in the 1990s, Amon turned from yeast to fruit flies in the laboratory of Ruth Lehmann, though she found fruit flies to be a far less attractive model than yeast; once you had worked with yeast, you were spoiled, she said.[10]The Amon lab primarily investigates yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model for understanding the controls that govern cell-cycle progression and received an Early Career Award grant, a PECAS award, from he NIH for this work in 1998.[1][23]  The PECAS is the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on young professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers.[24]  As a Whitehead Fellow, her team discovered that CDC20 plays a crucial role in cell division.[25]  Her Whitehead team identified an interaction between phosphatase and CDC14 which initiates the exit of cells from mitosis to the G1 phase.[10][26]  Amon's team demonstrated that CDC20 is the target protein in the spindle checkpoint during mitosis.[27]Amon's more recent work has investigated the regulation of chromosome segregation and how chromosomes are accurately transmitted to gametes in meiosis by examining gene regulatory networks. She identified two regulatory networks (FEAR and MEN) that promote the release of CDC14 which have the potential to identify the mechanisms that control the final stages of the mitotic cell cycle.[28][29][30][31]Her research group recently created haploid yeast cells containing extra copies of chromosomes and discovered that these aneuploid strains elicit phenotypes independent of the identity of the additional chromosome such as defects in cell cycle progression, increased energy demands, and interference with protein biosynthesis.[32]  Amon has also examined trisomy in the mouse as a model of mammalian cell growth and physiology and demonstrated that mammalian aneuploidy results in a stress response analogous to yeast aneuploidy.[33]  Amon's aneuploidy research has potential applications to cancer research.[34]  She found that aneuploidy can interfere with a cell's normal DNA repair mechanisms, allowing mutations to accumulate in tumor cells.[35]Awards and honors[edit]1998 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers[1]2003 Alan T.

He helped create a drug for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.[3] Krainer holds the St. Giles Foundation Professorship at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Laurel Hollow, New York.Early life and education[edit]Krainer was born in Montevideo, Uruguay to a Jewish family of Hungarian and Romanian descent. He has one older brother, who is a chemical engineer. His father did forced labor for two years in a Romanian labor camp (Ferma Alba) during World War II. After the war, his father's original surname, Kreiner changed to Krainer due to a clerical error when he was a refugee in Italy. His parents owned a small leather business in Montevideo. Krainer attended a private bilingual French-Spanish elementary school. He later attended a public school for two years before completing his pre-college education with four years at a private Spanish-Hebrew school. Krainer lived through political unrest during his teenage years, including urban guerrilla and military dictatorship. Krainer received a full scholarship from Columbia University and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry in 1981.[4] He graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. In 1986, he earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biochemistry from Harvard University.[5]Career and research[edit]From 1986 to 1989, Krainer conducted postdoctoral research as the first Cold Spring Harbor Fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Krainer worked as an assistant professor from 1989 to 1990, Associate Professor from 1990 to 1994, and Professor since 1994. Krainer is a faculty member of the graduate programs in Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at State University of New York, Stony Brook.[5] Krainer holds the St. Giles Foundation Professorship at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[6] His former students include Ewan Birney.[7][8] Krainer is a co-founder and Director of Stoke Therapeutics, based in Bedford, MA.Awards and honors[edit]In 2021 Krainer received the Wolf Prize in Medicine.[9] In 2019 he was awarded a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his contributions to the understanding of the RNA gene-splicing process and, in collaboration with fellow Prize Laureate Dr. Frank Bennet of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, the development of medical interventions that target the RNA-splicing process, including Spinraza, which is the first treatment for the genetic disorder Spinal Muscular Atrophy.[10][11] Other honors include:Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences (1992\u201396);National Institute of General Medical Sciences MERIT Award (2012-2022);New York Intellectual Property Law Association Inventor of the Year Award (2017);FE Bennett Award of the American Neurological Association (2017);RNA Society Lifetime Achievement Award (2019);Ross Prize in Molecular Medicine (2020);Gregor Johann Mendel Medal for Outstanding Achievements in Science (2020), Brno, Czech Republic;Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2016);Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (2018);Member of the National Academy of Medicine (2019);Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2020)[1]Personal life[edit]Krainer's father and maternal grandparents were Holocaust refugees.[10] He has three children, Emily, Andrew, and Brian.[10][5] His wife, Kate Krainer, is a plant geneticist.[12][13]References[edit]^ a b 2020 NAS Election. nasonline.org.

He is a professor of Biophysics at the Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University,[1] and shared the 2014 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award with Peter Walter for discoveries concerning the unfolded protein response \u2014 an intracellular quality control system that detects harmful misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and signals the nucleus to carry out corrective measures.[2]Early life and education[edit]Mori was born in 1958 in Kurashiki, Okayama. In the elementary school era, he was good at mathematics and arithmetic, and learned from the newspaper about the existence of quarks. In the middle school era, he was influenced by the Nobel Prize in Physics of Hideki Yukawa, and he decided to study physics at the Faculty of Science at Kyoto University (at the time, the golden age of elementary particle physics). However, he was finally admitted to the Department of Synthetic Chemistry of the Faculty of Engineering at Kyoto University.[3]When Mori was in the first year of college, he did not understand the significant difference between the laws of physics and chemistry, but he learned about the new development of molecular biology from newspaper articles. Soon after, Kyoto University alumnus Susumu Tonegawa made a breakthrough in immunology research (which earned Tonegawa the first Japanese Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine about a decade later), Mori read about it in the newspaper and was shocked, then he decided to transfer to the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and continue to pursue graduate studies. In 1985, he obtained a doctorate degree.[3]Career[edit]A simplified diagram of the initiation of the UPR by prolonged and overwhelming protein misfolding.Mori was appointed as an assistant professor at Gifu Pharmaceutical University in 1985, before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 1989, and he began research on unfolded protein response (UPR) in the United States. He was a researcher at the HSP (Heat Shock Protein) Research Institute in Kyoto from 1993 to 1999, and has been a member of the faculty of Kyoto University since 1999.[4] Meanwhile, he completed the copying of HAC1, ATF6 and BP1.The independent works of Mori and Peter Walter during the same period revealed the UPR pathway, which explains the mechanism by which cells generate signals due to stress and regulate. They discovered the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1) in 1993, which communicates the state of the endoplasmic reticulum protein production line. These research uncovered to form the basis for understanding and treating a wide range of important diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, fatty liver and dyslipidemia, a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory diseases.In 2003, Mori was transferred to the Department of Biophysics (Division of Biological Sciences) of Graduate School of Science at Kyoto University, the academic unit is also the first laboratory for molecular biology in Japan and has a long history.Recognition[edit]2005: Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences[5]2009: Canada Gairdner International Award[6]2010: Medal with Purple Ribbon2013: Asahi Prize2014: Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine[7]2014: Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award2015: Thomson Reuters Citation Laureates2016: Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy2018: Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[8]2018: Person of Cultural Merit2018: Momofuku Ando Prize[9]2023: Keio Medical Science Prize[10]2023: BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award[11]Personal life[edit]Mori obtained the qualification of the fifth section of Kendo in 1998.

He is currently the Director of the Bay Area Institute of Science at Altos Labs and an emeritus professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).[2][3] He was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator until 2022.Early life and education[edit]Walter was born and raised in West Berlin in 1954. His parents owned a pharmacy, and he was drawn to chemistry at a young age.[4] He entered the Free University of Berlin in 1973 to study chemistry, but the rigid way of teaching science did not engage him. Instead, Walter became interested in biochemistry, which studies the chemistry of cells.[4][5]In the last year of his Vordiplom (equivalent to a BSc) in 1976, he went on exchange to Vanderbilt University and conducted research under Thomas M. Harris at the Department of Chemistry on the biosynthetic pathway of slaframine, a fungal alkaloid that is toxic to cows.[6] Eventually, Walter completed his MSc in Vanderbilt in 1977.[1]At the encouragement of Stanford Moore, a biochemistry professor at Rockefeller University and a trustee of Vanderbilt, Walter applied for the PhD programme at Rockefeller.[6] He was placed on the waiting list, but after an accepted student went to Harvard University instead, was offered his place in 1977.[4][5] He took his PhD under G\u00fcnter Blobel, and obtained the degree in 1981.[1]Career[edit]After receiving his PhD, Walter stayed at Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral fellow for a year, then became an assistant professor at the Laboratory of Cell Biology at Rockefeller.[1]In 1983, he moved to the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) as an assistant professor. Walter was promoted to associate professor in 1986 and then full professor in five years later.[1] He was chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of UCSF between 2001 and 2008.[7]Walter became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in 1997, and served as the president of the American Society for Cell Biology in 2016.[8]In 2021, there were reports that he would be joining Altos Labs, a new biotechnology company which reportedly focuses on anti-aging research.[9][10] The next year, he retired from UCSF and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2022,[11][12] and joined Altos Labs as the Director of the Bay Area Institute of Science when the company officially launched.[13][14]Walter currently sits on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Zentrum f\u00fcr Molekulare Biologie der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg of Heidelberg University.[15]Walter is a coauthor of the widely used textbook Molecular Biology of the Cell.[16]Research[edit][1][2]During his PhD at G\u00fcnter Blobel's group, Walter purified a protein complex required for moving proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)[17] and showed the complex selectively recognizes newly synthesized secretory proteins.[18] He later confirmed the complex is in fact a nucleoprotein and identified the RNA component essential for the complex's function. He also named the complex signal recognition particle (SRP).[19]By the time Walter joined the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), researchers have established a connection between misfolded proteins in the ER and increased expression of a protein called BiP, which is a chaperone protein that helps other proteins fold correctly. This pathway is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, how cells sense misfolded proteins and relays this information to the cell nucleus to increase the production of UPR-target proteins remains unclear.[20]In 1993, working on baker's yeast, Walter found a gene, IRE1, which encodes a kinase. The IRE1 protein is located across the ER membrane, so a part of it can detect unfolded proteins inside the ER and the other part can phosphorylate proteins outside of the ER.[21] The same year, Kazutoshi Mori, at the time a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, independently made the same discovery.[22]Walter and Mori next independently sought the phosphorylation target of the IRE1 protein. Theoretically, upon phosphorylation, this target will enter the cell nucleus and increase the production of UPR-target proteins. Both of them arrived at the same gene, HAC1, in 1996.[23][24] This discovery, however, was unexpected as the HAC1 protein is produced only after IRE1 detects unfolded proteins, meaning the protein is not present to be phosphorylated by IRE1.This difference was mitigated by the finding of Mori and Walter that after IRE1 senses unfolded proteins, it splices the HAC1 precursor mRNA, which is transcribed from the HAC1 gene, resulting in a mature mRNA that is translated into the HAC1 protein.[25][26] Walter also discovered the phosphorylation target of IRE1, which turned out to be another IRE1 molecule, a process known as trans-autophosphorylation,[27] and also the enzyme stitching the spliced precursor HAC1 mRNA together.[28]In 2013, Walter's group identified a molecule that inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR is the cell's response to stresses such as viral infection, ultraviolet light and the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. ISR activates the EIF2\u03b1  protein, reducing most protein synthesis and increasing the production of some regulatory molecules.[29] His group found the inhibitor reversed EIF2\u03b1 activation, and named it ISRIB for integrated stress response inhibitor. Remarkably, they found mice injected with ISRIB had improved memory.[30] ISRIB was licensed to Alphabet subsidiary Calico in 2015.[31]Awards and honors[edit]1983 - Searle Scholar[32]1988 - Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry[33]1989 - Sloan Research Fellowship[34]2002 - Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[35]2004 - Member of the National Academy of Sciences[36]2004 - Associate Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization[37]2005 - Wiley Prize in Biomedical Science[38]2006 - Member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina[39]2009 - Gairdner Foundation International Award[40]2009 - E.B.

Chory is a professor and director of the Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[1]She leads the Salk Institute\u2019s Harnessing Plants Initiative (HPI), an innovative carbon dioxide removal approach to fight climate change by optimizing a plant\u2019s natural ability to capture and store carbon dioxide and adapt to different climate conditions. Chory and the HPI team aims to help plants grow bigger and stronger root systems that can absorb larger amounts of carbon by burying it in the ground in the form of suberin, a naturally occurring substance.[2][3]Considered the most influential plant biologist of the modern era and one of the greatest scientific innovators of our time, Chory's 30 years of work has pioneered the use of molecular genetics to study how plants change their shape and size to optimize photosynthesis and growth for different environments.[4][2][5]Chory was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society in 2011 and is the recipient of the 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the 2019 Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research.[6] She holds the Howard H. and Maryam R. Newman Chair in Plant Biology. She is also an adjunct professor in the Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, UC San Diego.[7] Chory and her HPI team received a $35 million award in support of the initiative from the TED Audacious Project in 2019 and another $30 million from the Bezos Earth Fund in 2020.[8][9]Biography[edit]Joanne Chory was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1955. Her Lebanese parents raised her along with her four brothers and one sister. She began her upper level education at Oberlin College in Ohio where she graduated with a degree in biology with honors. She then continued her post graduate education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It is here where she received her Ph.D.[10]She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Medical School in the lab of Frederick M. Ausubel.[11] In 1988 she joined the Salk Institute as an Assistant Professor. Chory eventually married her husband, Stephen Worland, with whom she has two adopted children.In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. She has struggled with the disease for well over a decade, but with the help of medications and a brain implant to help regulate her movement, she has continued her genetic research. Along with her passion for genetics, Chory strives to inspire young women to become scientists and is constantly working to improve the field for women.[10]Chory was not always interested in genetics. Her early career interests were centered in microbiology. Through her research in that field she developed a deeper interest in genetics, specifically research that was being done on Arabidopsis plants. Through her lengthy career in genetics she has been awarded numerous prestigious accolades for her many contributions to the field.[12]Career and research[edit]Joanne Chory focuses her research on finding a way to optimize plant growth to sustain a growing human population. She uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism, but her purpose is to optimize all plant growth and not just that of A. thaliana itself. She mutates the genes of the model organism and uses the results to understand the effects that these mutations have. She approaches this information from various directions including using genetics, genomics, cell biology, x-ray crystallography, biochemistry, and ecology. She has made strides in understanding light sensitivity and hormones in these plants. She uses this knowledge to optimize growth in other plants in hopes that we can better sustain a fast and ever-growing population.[1]Chory shows particular appreciation for manipulation of phenotypes of an organism.[13] Light signals are required for the induction and regulation of many developmental processes in plants. She has participated in research dissecting this complex process by isolating mutations that alter light-regulated seedling development in Arabidopsis.[14][15] Her work has identified mutants that are deficient in the phytochrome photoreceptors and in nuclear-localized repressors and has also revealed that steroid hormones control light-regulated seedling development. Dr. Chory's lab has been involved in the manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway for these steroids that altered the growth and development of plants and identification of the putative steroid receptor, a transmembrane receptor kinase.[16] Her group has also contributed towards the understanding of chloroplast to nuclear retrograde signaling[17][18] and plant shade avoidance responses.[19][20]Awards and honors[edit]2020 Pearl Meister Greengard Prize2019 Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research [21]2018 Gruber Prize in Genetics[22]2018 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[23]2015 Elected to the American Philosophical Society[24]2012 Genetics Society of America Medal[25]2011 Elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society[26]2009 Elected Foreign Associate, Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, France2008 Member, German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina2006 Associate Member, EMBO2005 Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science2004 Kumho Award in Plant Molecular Biology [27]2003  Scientific American 50: Research Leader in Agriculture2000  L'Oreal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science1999 Elected Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences1998 Elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences1997 Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute[28]1995 Charles Albert Schull Award, awarded by American Society of Plant Biologists1994 NAS Award for Initiatives in ResearchReferences[edit]^ a b Professor Joanne Chory ForMemRS.

She is the director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute.[5][6]She became the editor of the Annual Review of Neuroscience as of 2018.[7]Her work helped elucidate the genes and genetic mechanisms responsible for a number of devastating neurological disorders, such as Rett syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.[8] Zoghbi's discoveries have provided new ways of thinking about other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, autism and intellectual disability, which could lead to new therapeutics and better, more efficient treatments.[9][10]In 2017, she was awarded the Canada Gairdner International Award and the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.Early life and education[edit]Huda Zoghbi was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1954, and raised in Beirut. She loved reading works by William Shakespeare, Jane Austen and William Wordsworth in high school and intended to pursue literature at university.[11] Her mother convinced her to study biology instead, on the grounds that 'a woman growing up in the Middle East should pick a career ensuring independence and security, while she can always write on the side'.[12][11]  Zoghbi was admitted as a biological sciences major at the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1973 and entered the university's medical school 2 years later.[11]The Lebanese Civil War began in 1976 during her first year of medical school.  Although she and her classmates decided to stay at the university, after her brother was injured by shrapnel, their parents sent them to live with their sister in Austin, Texas, with plans to return the following summer.[11][13] The war, however, raged on, and Zoghbi was under the impression that school terms at American medical schools began in October, as was the case with Lebanese schools. However, in October, it was confirmed that she was still unable to return to Lebanon due to the war, and US medical schools had begun their fall term 2 months earlier. Her family friends in America suggested she apply to Vanderbilt University.  Vanderbilt did not accept transfer students, but recommended Meharry Medical College instead; Meharry accepted her on the spot.[13] Despite her continued desire to return to Lebanon the next summer, on the advice of professors at AUB, she stayed at Meharry and earned an MD degree in 1979, after which she joined the Texas Children's Hospital at the Baylor College of Medicine as a pediatric resident.[11]Zoghbi initially intended to specialise in pediatric cardiology, out of an interest in the heart. During her rotation at pediatric neurology, Marvin Fishman, the head of the division, convinced her that the brain was more interesting than the heart. She thus started a 3-year term as a postdoctoral researcher in pediatric neurology after she finished her residency in 1982.Career[edit]Huda Zoghbi, Kavli Prize Laureate, interviews at Munch Museum, Oslo, Norway. Photo: Thomas EckhoffFrom 1982 to 1985, Zoghbi was a postdoctoral researcher in pediatric neurology at the Baylor College of Medicine. She became an assistant professor at the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor in 1988, and was successively promoted to associate professor in 1991 and professor in 1994.[14] At present, Zoghbi is a professor at the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor, with appointments as a professor at the Department of Neuroscience and the Department of Pediatrics Section of Neurology and Developmental Neuroscience, the Ralph Feigin, M.D. Endowed Chair, the director of the Texas Children's Hospital Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, a member of the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor, and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[5] She is also a member of the board of directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.[1] She also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2014.Research[edit]In 1983, Zoghbi learnt of Rett syndrome from Bengt Hagberg's account in Annals of Neurology. The paper allowed Zoghbi to diagnose a five-year-old she treated at Texas Children's Hospital, and a week later she saw another patient with the same set of symptoms. When she investigated medical records, she found more cases of Rett syndrome that had been misdiagnosed. This sparked her interest in Rett syndrome, at a time when there was no report of the disease in the US.[3] An article she published in 1985[15] attracted many Rett syndrome patients to Texas Children's Hospital, giving her access to a large number of cases.[16]Since most patients of Rett syndrome were girls, and symptoms were very consistent across patients, Zoghbi believed genetics were involved in the disease process.[3] This led her to join Arthur Beaudet's group in 1985, after finishing her term as a postdoctoral researcher, for training in genetics and molecular biology.[13] Beaudet advised against Rett syndrome as her research project since its mode of inheritance was still not obvious, and recommended a more approachable problem \u2013 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, a dominantly inherited neurological disorder. In 1988, Zoghbi left Beaudet's group and founded her own lab at Baylor.[11] In addition to her research on spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and Rett syndrome, Zoghbi is participating in a joint research collaboration into CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder, funded by the Loulou Foundation, Baylor College of Medicine and the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute (NRI) at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital[17]Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1[edit]Following the establishment of her own lab, Zoghbi continued studying spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), in collaboration with Harry Orr from the University of Minnesota.[18] On the same day, 8 April 1993, both Zoghbi and Orr identified ATXN1 as the gene responsible for SCA1.[13] They determined that the disease was caused by an expansion of the glutamine-encoding CAG trinucleotide repeat in this gene, and that the younger the age of onset, the longer the CAG repeat.[19]  Further work by Zoghbi, Orr and their teams demonstrated that the misfolding, aggregation, and proteasomal degradation of the protein product of this gene, Ataxin 1, played a role in the disorder.[20]Math1[edit]After solving the etiology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, Zoghbi began studying animal genes related to balance. As Baylor's Hugo J. Bellen described the role of the atonal gene in balance in fruit flies, Zoghbi chose to study its mammalian homolog.  A member of her lab successfully cloned the mouse homolog, Math1, in 1996.[21] Her team went on to find that, in addition to its involvement in balance and coordination, Math1 is also crucial to hearing,[22] the formation of secretory cells in the gut.[23], and neonatal respiratory rhythm and chemosensitivity in the adult brain by regulating the development of a group of hindbrain neurons.[24] Her lab has also shown that aberrant activation of Math1 could lead to medulloblastoma, a common childhood brain tumor, and that mice which did not express Math1, did not develop the tumor.[25]Rett syndrome[edit]Ever since Zoghbi was introduced to Rett syndrome early in her career, she has been working on the disorder alongside other research, despite the lack of enthusiasm from her colleagues, fellow researchers and funding agencies. The main reason is that very few individuals and even fewer families are available for investigation. In the 1990s, she collaborated with Uta Francke from Stanford University to identify the gene responsible for Rett syndrome. In 1992, she narrowed down the target to a section of the X chromosome.[26] In 1999, a postdoctoral researcher in Zoghbi's lab identified MECP2 as the causative gene.[27] The MECP2 protein binds methylated cytosine (5-methylcytosine) in CpG sites, and is indispensable for almost all brain cells.[13] In the paper, she and her team demonstrated that Rett syndrome was an X-linked dominant disorder, meaning that when 1 of the 2 copies of the MECP2 gene is abnormal, Rett syndrome will result.[12]Zoghbi's team keeps studying MECP2, and discovered in 2004 that overexpressing the protein in mouse led to an autism-like neurological disorder.[28] In 2009, she found mice deficient of the Mecp2 gene (the mouse homolog of human MECP2) had lower levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin,[29] consistent with her clinical observations of patients of Rett syndrome in 1985. Recently, Zoghbi confirmed that the MECP2 protein also bound 5-methylcytosine not in CpG sites,[30] and that restoring the level of MECP2 protein in a subset of neurons was sufficient to rescue some symptoms of Rett syndrome.[31]Ataxin-1 link to Alzheimer's[edit]After linking the gene Ataxin-1 to SCA1, Zoghbi's lab was approached by Dr. Jaehong Suh of the Massachusetts General Hospital's MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease to investigate the connection between ataxin-1 gene and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.[32] The subsequent study found that loss of ataxin-1 elevates BACE1 expression and A\u03b2 pathology in mouse models, rendering it a potential contributor to risk and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.[33]Awards and honors[edit]2022 \u2013 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience.[34]2020 \u2013 Brain Prize[35]2019 \u2013 Victor A.

Ohsumi is a professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology's Institute of Innovative Research.[1] He received the Kyoto Prize for Basic Sciences in 2012,[2] the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[3] for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy.[4]Biography[edit]Ohsumi addressed at Gairdner Foundation International Award Ceremony (at the Royal Ontario Museum in October 2015)with John Dirks, Kenjir\u014d Monji and D. Lorne TyrrellOhsumi was born on February 9, 1945, in Fukuoka. He received a B.Sci. in 1967 and a D.Sci. in 1974, both from the University of Tokyo. In 1974\u201377 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University in New York City.[1]He returned to the University of Tokyo in 1977 as a research associate; he was appointed Lecturer there in 1986, and promoted to Associate Professor in 1988. In 1996, he moved to the National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan in Okazaki City, where he was appointed as a professor. From 2004 to 2009, he was also professor at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Hayama. In 2009, he transitioned to a three-way appointment as an emeritus professor at the National Institute for Basic Biology and at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies, and a professorship at the Advanced Research Organization, Integrated Research Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech). After his retirement in 2014, he continued to serve as Professor at Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology. Currently, he is head of the Cell Biology Research Unit, Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology.[5]Christian de Duve coined the term autophagy in 1963 whereas Ohsumi began his work in 1988. Prior to that time, less than 20 papers per year were published on this subject.[6] During the 1990s, Ohsumi's group described the morphology of autophagy in yeast, and performed mutational screening on yeast cells that identified essential genes for cells to be capable of autophagy.[7][8]In 2016, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy.[9][10] He is the 25th Japanese person to be awarded a Nobel Prize.[11] Ohsumi's spouse Mariko, a Professor of Teikyo University of Science, collaborated on his research.[12] She is a co-author of many academic papers with him.[13]Recognition[edit]Ohsumi in his Tokyo Tech labSource:[5]2005 \u2013 Fujihara Award, Fujihara Foundation of Science2006 \u2013 Japan Academy Prize, Japan Academy2007 \u2013 Science Award, Botanical Society of Japan\u00a0[ja]2008 \u2013 Asahi Prize, Asahi Shimbun2012 \u2013 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences[14]2013 \u2013 Thomson Reuters Citation Laureate2015 \u2013 Gairdner Foundation International Award2015 \u2013 International Prize for Biology2015 \u2013 Keio Medical Science Prize2015 \u2013 Person of Cultural Merit2015 \u2013 Rosenstiel Award2016 \u2013 Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences2016 \u2013 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research2016 \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine[15]2017 \u2013 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[16]Selected publications[edit]His original findings about autophagy in yeast cells:[17]Takeshige K; Baba M; Tsuboi S; Noda T; Ohsumi Y (October 1992).

Nusse did a postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of Harold Varmus at the University of California, San Francisco.  In 1982, Nusse and Varmus discovered the Wnt1 gene.[3]After his postdoctoral fellowship, Nusse joined the Netherlands Cancer Institute expanding on the earlier work on the Wnt pathway and identifying the pathway in fruit flies. In 1990, he joined the department of Developmental Biology at Stanford University. His lab is currently focused on the role of Wnt in stem cell development and tissue repair.Awards[edit]Nusse received the Peter Debye Prize from the University of Maastricht in 2000.  He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, European Molecular Biology Organization, and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1997).[4] He is  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[1] He won a Breakthrough Prize in 2017.[5] In 2020 he received the Canada Gairdner International Award.[6]References[edit]^ a b Roel Nusse.

P\u00e4\u00e4bo earned his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1986 for research investigating how the E19 protein of adenoviruses modulates the immune system.[24]Research and career[edit]P\u00e4\u00e4bo at the 2014 Nobel ConferenceP\u00e4\u00e4bo is known as one of the founders of paleogenetics, a discipline that uses genetics to study early humans and other ancient species.[25][26]From 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of Zurich, Switzerland.[27]As an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow, P\u00e4\u00e4bo moved to the United States in 1987, accepting a position as a postdoctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Allan Wilson's lab and worked on the genome of extinct mammals.[27][28]In 1990, he returned to Europe to become professor of general biology at the University of Munich, and, in 1997, he became founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.[28]In 1997, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and colleagues reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley.[29][30]In August 2002, P\u00e4\u00e4bo's department published findings about the language gene, FOXP2, which is mutated in some individuals with language disabilities.[31]In 2006, P\u00e4\u00e4bo announced a plan to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals. In 2007, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year.[32]In February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome.[33] Over 3\u00a0billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the 454 Life Sciences Corporation.[34]In March 2010, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus Homo that had not yet been recognised, the Denisova hominin.[35] P\u00e4\u00e4bo first wanted to classify the Denisovans as a species of their own, separate from modern humans and Neanderthals but changed his mind after peer-review.[36][37]P\u00e4\u00e4bo's doctoral student Viviane Slon was able to successfully map the Denisovan genome, clarifying geographic distribution and admixtures in archaic humans.[38][39]In May 2010, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal Science.[40] He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans.[41] There is general mainstream support in the scientific community for this theory of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans.[42] This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, in the Middle East.[43]In 2014, he published the book Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes where he, in the mixed form of a memoir and popular science, tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome combined with his thoughts on human evolution.[20][44]In 2020, Hugo Zeberg and Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo determined that more severe impacts upon victims of the COVID-19 disease, including the vulnerability to it and the incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation, have been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.[45] The findings were described in a Nature article with Hugo Zeberg from Karolinska Institutet and Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo from the Max Planck Institute.[45]As of October\u00a02022[update], P\u00e4\u00e4bo has an h-index of 167 according to Google Scholar[4] and of 133 according to Scopus.[46]Awards and honours[edit]P\u00e4\u00e4bo showed the medal of Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Fumio Kishida (February 1, 2023).In 1992, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. P\u00e4\u00e4bo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2000, and in 2004 was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences.[47] In 2005, he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine.[1] In 2008, P\u00e4\u00e4bo was added to the members of the Order Pour le M\u00e9rite for Sciences and Arts. In the same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[48] In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that P\u00e4\u00e4bo had been awarded the 2009 Kistler Prize for his work isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old mummy.[49] In June 2010, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor B\u00fccher Medal for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[50] In 2013, he received Gruber Prize in Genetics for groundbreaking research in evolutionary genetics.[51] In June 2015, he was awarded the degree of DSc (honoris causa) at NUI Galway.[52] He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 2016,[2] and in 2017, was awarded the Dan David Prize. In 2018, he received the Princess of Asturias Awards in the category of Scientific Research, in 2020 the Japan Prize,[53] in 2021 the Massry Prize[54] and in 2022 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine[55] for sequencing the first Neanderthal genome.[14]Personal life[edit]P\u00e4\u00e4bo wrote in his 2014 book Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes that he is bisexual. He assumed he was gay until he met Linda Vigilant, an American primatologist and geneticist whose boyish charms attracted him. They have co-authored many papers, are married and raising a son and a daughter together in Leipzig.[56][6]See also[edit]Origins of Us (2011 BBC series)First Peoples (2015 PBS series)List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or MedicineList of Swedish Nobel laureatesReferences[edit]^ a b Professor Svante P\u00c4\u00c4BO | Jeantet. 1 October 2017.

Noller (born June 10, 1939[citation needed]) is an American biochemist, and since 1992 the director of the  University of California, Santa Cruz's Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of the ribosome and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Early life and education[edit]Noller is a native of Oakland, California.[1] He earned his B.S. degree in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1960 [2] and his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Oregon[3] in 1965 [2]He carried out post-doctoral work at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and the Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva.[1]Scientific contributions and honors[edit]Noller joined the faculty at University of California, Santa Cruz in 1968.[3] In his decades-long study of the molecular translational machinery of the cell, he has made fundamental contributions in understanding the structure and function of the cell's protein-synthesis factory, the ribosome.  Notable amongst these contributions are having demonstrated that the ribosome is a ribozyme and leading the solution of the first crystal structures at molecular resolution for complete ribosomes.[4][5][6]Noller was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992.[3] He has been recognized with prizes from the Paul Ehrlich Foundation in 2006 and the Gairdner Foundation in 2007, each of which was shared with eventual winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2009.[1][7] He won a Breakthrough Prize in 2016.[8]References[edit]^ a b c Harry F.

WalkerStephen Joseph Elledge (born August 7, 1956) is an American geneticist. He is the current Gregor Mendel Professor of Genetics and of Medicine at the Department of Genetics of Harvard Medical School and in the Division of Genetics of the Brigham and Women's Hospital.[3][4] His research is focused on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic response to DNA damage and is known as the discoverer of the DNA damage response (DDR).Early life and education[edit]Elledge was born in Paris, Illinois in 1956.[2] He also grew in up, graduating from Paris High School in 1974. He has been interested in chemistry since childhood, thanks to a chemistry set his grandmother gave him.[5]He entered the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in chemistry and hoping to become an organic chemist.[6] Elledge initially ignored life science subjects, until he attended biology and genetics courses on exchange to the University of Southampton, England, during his third (or junior) year. He took biochemistry courses after returning to Illinois,[7] which prompted him to study PhD in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after obtaining his BSc in 1978.[8] Elledge graduated from MIT in 1983.[2]Career[edit]Elledge started his career as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in 1984 in Ronald W. Davis's group.[8] In 1989, he moved to the Baylor College of Medicine as an assistant professor in biochemistry,[9] He was promoted to associate professor in 1993 and full professor in 1995.[2]In 2003, Elledge joined the Department of Genetics of Harvard Medical School.[10][11]Currently, Elledge is the Gregor Mendel Professor of Genetics and of Medicine at the Department of Genetics of Harvard Medical School and in the Division of Genetics of the Brigham and Women's Hospital.[3][12] He also sits on the Board of Advisory Scientists of the Whitehead Institute[13] and the advisory board of Molecular Cell.[14]Elledge has been an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1993.[15]Research[edit]Elledge's research spans multiple areas, including cell cycle, DNA repair, and detection of virus from blood.He began studying DNA repair during his years at Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow. Elledge accidentally[16] discovered the RNR2 gene and protein in yeast, which belongs to the family of ribonucleotide reductase, and found that its expression increases when DNA is damaged.[17] The human counterparts of RNR2, or homologs, are RRM2 and RRM2B.[18]Over the next decade, he continued the search for genes and proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathway in yeasts and humans. Examples include DUN1,[19] MEC1, and TEL1 in yeasts,[20] (respective human homologs are CHEK2, ATR, and ATM) and CHEK1[21] and CHEK2[22] in humans.In cell cycle research, his group published two important papers on cell cycle checkpoints in 1993. In parallel and independently from Bert Vogelstein's group, he discovered and characterized p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein that blocks G1/S transition.[23] He also showed that the Rb protein physically associates with PP1a from mitosis until mid-G1 phase in yeasts.[24] After moving to the Baylor College of Medicine, Elledge reported his identification of CDK2, a protein whose activation allows cells to transit from the G1 phase into the S phase of the cell cycle.[25]Elledge's group also discovered the F-box protein structural motif, and found that it recognizes specific protein sequences and tags the proteins with ubiquitin for degradation.[26] He correctly predicted the central role of F-Box in protein degradation due to the large number of proteins having this motif.[27]In 2015, Elledge's group developed VirScan, a platform that detects viral infection in patients from a small amount of blood.[28][29][30]In recent years, Elledge has continued to expand his research area. For instance, his group reported a computational model that predicted the likelihood of regions on the chromosome to be abnormally amplified.[31][32]During the COVID-19 pandemic, Elledge estimated that United States has lost a total of 2.5 million years of life.[33][34][35][36]Personal life[edit]Elledge was married to Mitzi Kuroda,[37] herself a professor at the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School.[38] They both moved from Baylor College of Medicine to Harvard Medical School in 2003.[39]Awards[edit]Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research (2001)[40]National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology (2002)[41]Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2003)[42]Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2003)[43]Hans Sigrist Prize (2005)[44]Genetics Society of America Medal (2005)[45]Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology (2005)[46]Member of the Institute of Medicine) (now National Academy of Medicine) (2006)[47]Dickson Prize (2010)[48]Lewis S.

        "Data": "American medical researcherHelen HobbsBornMay 5, 1952Boston, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanEducationStanford University (BS)Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (MD)OccupationProfessorEmployerUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterHelen Haskell Hobbs (born May 5, 1952 in Boston, Massachusetts)[1] is an American medical researcher who is professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, who won a 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the 2018 Harrington Prize for Innovation in Medicine.[2] She and Jonathan C. Cohen found that people with hypomorphic PCSK9 mutations had lower LDL-cholesterol levels and were almost immune to heart disease. This finding led to the development of a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that mimic the effects of the PCSK9 mutations.[3]  She and Cohen also identified the first genetic risk factor for fatty liver disease, a burgeoning health problem that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Their laboratory has shown that mutation in PNPLA3 causes accumulation of PNPLA3 on lipid droplets, which compromises the mobilization of triglycerides from liver cells. She sits on the Board of Directors at Pfizer.Education[edit]Hobbs graduated from Stanford University and went to medical school at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. She completed an internship in internal medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center,[4] where she met her future husband, a Texan who trained at UT Southwestern.[5] Together, Hobbs and her husband, Dr. Dennis Stone, moved to Dallas, Texas in 1980, where she completed her medical training at Parkland Memorial Hospital, including a one-year stint as chief resident.Following the advice of Donald Seldin,[6] the chairman of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, she chose to pursue research after residency.  Again, following Dr. Seldin's recommendation, Hobbs took a research post-doctoral position studying lipoproteins at UT Southwestern in the laboratory of Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein, Nobel Prize in Medicine winners in 1985.Research[edit]In 1987 Hobbs joined the faculty of UT Southwestern Medical Center where she is the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development.[7] In 1999, she co-founded the Dallas Heart Study with a grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.[8]  This study takes genetic samples of a representative segment of the population of Dallas County, and correlates them to the subject's health metrics. Through this study, she found that variations in the gene PCSK9[9] led to lower plasma cholesterol and protection from cardiovascular disease. Another major focus of her career is to understand the basis of fatty liver disease. She and Jonathan Cohen have shown that variations in the DNA sequences of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 confer susceptibility to fatty liver disease, soon to be the number one indication for liver transplantation.Awards[edit]YearAward[9]2019Anitschkow Prize2018Foundation Lefoulon-Delalande Grand prix Award2018Harrigton Prize for Innovation in Medicine2017Schottenstein Prize2016Passano Award (with Jonathan C.

He completed his medical internship and psychiatry residency at Stanford University School of Medicine.Career[edit]Deisseroth has led his laboratory at Stanford University since 2004.[citation needed] He serves as an attending physician at Stanford Hospital and Clinics and has been affiliated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) since 2009.[1][2] Between 2014 and 2019, he was a foreign Adjunct Professor at Sweden's Karolinska Medical Institute.[citation needed]In 2021, he authored a book titled Projections: A Story of Human Emotions, published by Random House, where he explores the origins of human emotions through personal encounters with patients.[3]Research[edit]Light-gated ion channels, optogenetics, and neural circuits of behaviorDeisseroth named this field optogenetics in 2006 and followed up with optogenetic technology development work leading to many applications, including psychiatry and neurology. In 2010, the journal Nature Methods named optogenetics Method of the Year.[4]For developing optogenetics, Deisseroth received in 2010 the Nakasone Award; in 2013 the Lounsbery Award and the Dickson Prize in Science; in 2014 the Keio Medical Science Prize; and in 2015 the Albany Prize, Lurie Prize, Dickson Prize in Medicine, and Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[5] He also received the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine, jointly with Edward Boyden and Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck. In 2016, Deisseroth received the Massry Prize along with Peter Hegemann and Miesenb\u00f6ck for optogenetics, a technology that utilizes light to control cells in living tissues.[6] In 2016, the Harvey Prize from the Technion in Israel was awarded to Deisseroth and Hegemann for their discovery of opsin molecules, involved in sensing light in microorganisms, and their pioneering work in using these opsins to develop optogenetics.[7] Deisseroth was then awarded Japan's highest private prize, the Kyoto Prize, in 2018, for his discovery of optogenetics and the development of causal systems neuroscience, becoming the youngest recipient of the award to date.[8][9] In 2019, Deisseroth, Hegemann, Boyden, and Miesenb\u00f6ck won the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize.[10] Finally in 2020, Deisseroth received the Heineken Prize from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, for developing optogenetics \u2014 a method to influence the activity of nerve cells with light.[11]Deisseroth is also known for achieving insight into the light-gated ion channel pore of channelrhodopsin itself, through his teams' initial high-resolution crystal structures of cation and anion-conducting channelrhodopsins[12][13][14] and through a body of structure/function work discovering mechanisms of channelrhodopsin kinetics, ion selectivity, and color selectivity, together with his frequent collaborator Peter Hegemann.[15] Two major prizes paid particular attention to Deisseroth's work on elucidation of the structure and function of light-gated ion channels\u2014the 2016 Harvey Prize to Deisseroth and Hegemann for the discovery of opsin molecules, involved in sensing light in microorganisms, and for the pioneering work in utilizing these opsins to develop optogenetics,[7] and the 2018 Gairdner Award, which noted his group discovered the fundamental principles of the unique channelrhodopsin proteins in molecular detail by a wide range of genomic, biophysical, electrophysiological and structural techniques with many mutants in close collaboration with Peter Hegemann).[16]Although the first peer-reviewed paper[17] demonstrating activation of neurons with a channelrhodopsin was from his lab in mid-2005, Deisseroth has emphasized that many pioneering laboratories around the world[18] were also working on the idea and published their papers within the following year; he cites Stefan Herlitze[19] and Alexander Gottschalk/Georg Nagel,[20] who published their papers in late 2005, and Hiromu Yawo[21] and Zhuo-Hua Pan,[22] who published their initial papers in 2006 (Pan's early observation of optical activation of retinal neurons expressing channelrhodopsin would have occurred in August 2004, according to Pan,[23] about a month after Deisseroth's initial observation). Deisseroth has published the notebook pages from early July 2004 of his initial experiment showing light activation of neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin.[24] Deisseroth also pointed out[24] that an even earlier experiment had occurred and was published by Heberle and B\u00fcldt in 1994, in which functional heterologous expression of a bacteriorhodopsin for light-activated ion flow had been published in a non-neural system (yeast).[25] Optogenetics with microbial opsins as a general technology for neuroscience was enabled only by the full development of versatile strategies for targeting opsins and light to specific cells in behaving animals by taking advantage of Cre-lox neurogenetics developed by Joe Tsien in the 1990s.[24][26][27]Other awards:Deisseroth's 2018 Kyoto Prize cited his causal systems neuroscience.[28]The 2013 Pasarow Prize[29] was awarded to Deisseroth for neuropsychiatry research.[30]The 2013 Premio Citta di Firenze was given to Deisseroth for innovative technologies to probe the structure and dynamics of circuits related to schizophrenia, autism, narcolepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety and addiction.[31]The Redelsheimer Award from the Society for Biological Psychiatry was awarded to Deisseroth for furthering the field's understanding of the neuroscience underlying behavior.[32]Deisseroth's 2017 Fresenius Prize[33] cited his discoveries in optogenetics and hydrogel-tissue chemistry, as well as his research into the neural circuit basis of depression.[34]Chemical assembly of functional materials in tissueDeisseroth is known also for a separate class of technological innovation. His group has developed methods for chemical assembly of functional materials within biological tissue. This approach has a range of applications, including probing the molecular composition and wiring of cells within intact brains.In 2013, Deisseroth was senior author of a paper describing the initial form of this method, called CLARITY (with a team including first author postdoctoral fellow in his lab Kwanghun Chung,[35] and neuroscientist Viviana Gradinaru).[36] This method makes biological tissues, such as mammalian brains, translucent and accessible to molecular probes.[37]CLARITY[38]has been widely used,[39]and many variants on the basic HTC backbone have been developed in other labs as well since 2013 (reviewed in[40]).A key feature of HTC is that the hydrogel-tissue hybrid becomes the substrate for future chemical and optical interrogation that can be probed and manipulated in new ways.[40] For example, HTC variants now enable improved anchoring and amplification of RNA, reversible size changes (contraction or expansion), and in situ sequencing (reviewed in[40]). In particular, STARmap is an HTC variant that allows three-dimensional cellular-resolution transcriptomic readouts within intact tissue.[41][42][43])Several major prizes have cited Deisseroth's development of HTC, including:The 2017 Fresenius Prize for his discoveries in optogenetics and hydrogel-tissue chemistry, as well as his research into the neural circuit basis of depression.[44][33][45]The 2015 Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences  for leading the development of optogenetics, a technology for controlling cells with light to determine function, as well as for CLARITY, a method for transforming intact organs into transparent polymer gels to allow visualization of biological structures with high resolution and detail.[46]The 2013 Premio Citta di Firenze[31]The Redelsheimer Award for optogenetics, CLARITY, and other novel and powerful neural circuit approaches in furthering the field's understanding of the neuroscience underlying behavior.[47]The 2015 Dickson Prize in Medicine[48]The 2020 Heineken Prize for Medicine, for developing optogenetics \u2014 a method to influence the activity of nerve cells with light \u2014 as well as for developing hydrogel-tissue chemistry, which enables researchers to make biological tissue accessible to light and molecular probes.[49]Honors and awards[edit]2005 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers[50]2010 Nakasone Award, Human Frontier Science Program[51]2010 Koetser Award for Brain Research[52]2011 W.

Boyden is an American neuroscientist at MIT. He is the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology, a faculty member in the MIT Media Lab and an associate member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. In 2018 he was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. He is recognized for his work on optogenetics. In this technology, a light-sensitive ion channel such as channelrhodopsin-2 is genetically expressed in neurons, allowing neuronal activity to be controlled by light. There were early efforts to achieve targeted optical control dating back to 2002 that did not involve a directly light-activated ion channel,[1] but it was the method based on directly light-activated channels from microbes, such as channelrhodopsin, emerging in 2005 that turned out to be broadly useful. Optogenetics in this way has been widely adopted by neuroscientists as a research tool, and it is also thought to have potential therapeutic applications.[2] Boyden joined the MIT faculty in 2007, and continues to develop new optogenetic tools as well as other technologies for the manipulation of brain activity. Previously, Boyden received degrees in electrical engineering, computer science, and physics from MIT.[3] During high school, Boyden attended the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science.[4]Dr. Boyden is the co-founder of Elemind,[5] a stealth neurotechnology company that augments sleep, attention, and the human experience,[6] as well as Cognito Therapeutics,[7] a company developing therapeutics designed to improve the lives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease.Awards[edit]In 2008 Boyden was named by Discover Magazine as one of the top 20 scientists under 40.[8] In 2006, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[9] In 2013 he shared the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award for Biotechnology and Medicine with Karl Deisseroth and Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck.[10]On November 29, 2015, Edward Boyden was one of five scientists honored with the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, awarded for \u201ctransformative advances toward understanding living systems and extending human life.\u201d[11][12]He has received the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine, jointly with Karl Deisseroth and Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck, for the development of optogenetics, the most unique technique for studying the brain today.[13] In 2018, Boyden won the Canada Gairdner Foundation International Award, jointly with Karl Deisseroth and Peter Hegemann. In 2019, he was awarded the Rumford Prize for extraordinary contributions related to the invention and refinement of optogenetics, with Ernst Bamberg, Karl Deisseroth, Peter Hegemann, Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck, and Georg Nagel.[14] In the same year, he, Deisseroth, Hegemann, and Miesenb\u00f6ck won the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize.[15]He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2019.[16] In 2020, Boyden was awarded with the Wilhelm Exner Medal.[17]References[edit]^ Zemelman; Lee GA; Ng M; Miesenb\u00f6ck G.

        "URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Gary_Ruvkun",
        "Data": "American geneticistGary Bruce Ruvkun (born March 1952, Berkeley, California)[1] is  an American molecular biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.[2]  Ruvkun discovered the mechanism by which lin-4, the first microRNA (miRNA) discovered by Victor Ambros, regulates the translation of target messenger RNAs via imperfect base-pairing to those targets, and discovered the second miRNA, let-7, and that it is conserved across animal phylogeny, including in humans. These miRNA discoveries revealed a new world of RNA regulation at an unprecedented small size scale, and the mechanism of that regulation.  Ruvkun also discovered many features of insulin-like signaling in the regulation of aging and metabolism.He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.Education[edit]Ruvkun obtained his undergraduate degree in 1973 at the University of California, Berkeley. His PhD work was done at Harvard University in the laboratory of Frederick M. Ausubel, where he investigated bacterial nitrogen fixation genes. Ruvkun completed post-doctoral studies with Robert Horvitz at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Walter Gilbert of Harvard.[3]Research[edit]mRNA lin-4[edit]Ruvkun's research revealed that the miRNA lin-4, a 22 nucleotide regulatory RNA discovered in 1992 by Victor Ambros' lab, regulates its target mRNA lin-14 by forming imperfect RNA duplexes to down-regulate translation. The first indication that the key regulatory element of the lin-14 gene recognized by the lin-4 gene product was in the lin-14 3\u2019 untranslated region came from the analysis of lin-14 gain-of-function mutations which showed that they are deletions of conserved elements in the lin-14 3\u2019 untranslated region.  Deletion of these elements relieves the normal late stage-specific repression of LIN-14 protein production, and lin-4 is necessary for that repression by the normal lin-14 3' untranslated region.[4][5]  In a key breakthrough, the Ambros lab discovered that lin-4  encodes a very small RNA product, defining the 22 nucleotide miRNAs.  When Ambros and Ruvkun compared the sequence of the lin-4 miRNA and the lin-14 3\u2019 untranslated region, they discovered that the lin-4 RNA base pairs with conserved bulges and loops to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the  lin-14 target mRNA, and that the lin-14 gain of function mutations delete these lin-4 complementary sites to relieve the normal repression of translation by lin-4.   In addition, they showed that the lin-14 3' untranslated region could confer this lin-4-dependent translational repression on unrelated mRNAs by creating chimeric mRNAs that were lin-4-responsive.  In 1993, Ruvkun reported in the journal Cell on the regulation of lin-14 by lin-4.[6] In the same issue of Cell, Victor Ambros described the regulatory product of lin-4 as a small RNA[7]  These papers revealed a new world of RNA regulation at an unprecedented small size scale, and the mechanism of that regulation.[8][9] Together, this research is now recognized as the first description of microRNAs and the mechanism by which partially base-paired miRNA::mRNA duplexes inhibit translation.[10]microRNA, let-7[edit]In 2000, the Ruvkun lab reported the identification of second C. elegans microRNA, let-7, which like the first microRNA regulates translation of the target gene, in this case lin-41, via imperfect base pairing to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of that mRNA.[11][12] This was an indication that miRNA regulation via 3\u2019 UTR complementarity may be a common feature, and that there were likely to be more microRNAs.  The generality of microRNA regulation to other animals was established by the Ruvkun lab later in 2000,  when they reported that the sequence and regulation of the let-7 microRNA is conserved across animal phylogeny, including in humans.[13]  Presently thousands of miRNAs have been discovered, pointing to a world of gene regulation at this size regime.miRNAs and siRNAs[edit]When siRNAs of the same 21-22 nucleotide size as lin-4 and let-7 were discovered in 1999 by Hamilton and Baulcombe in plants,[14] the fields of RNAi and miRNAs suddenly converged. It seemed likely that the similarly sized  miRNAs and siRNAs would use similar mechanisms. In a collaborative effort, the Mello and Ruvkun labs showed that the first known components of RNA interference and their paralogs, Dicer and the PIWI proteins, are used by both miRNAs and siRNAs.[15] Ruvkun's lab in 2003 identified many more miRNAs,[16][17] identified miRNAs from mammalian neurons,[18] and in 2007 discovered many new protein-cofactors for miRNA function.[19][20][21]C. elegans metabolism and longevity[edit]Ruvkun's laboratory has also discovered that an insulin-like signaling pathway controls C. elegans metabolism and longevity. Klass[22]  Johnson[23] and Kenyon[24] showed that the developmental arrest program mediated by mutations in age-1 and daf-2 increase C. elegans longevity.  The Ruvkun lab established that these genes constitute an insulin like receptor and a downstream phosphatidylinositol kinase that couple to the daf-16 gene product, a highly conserved Forkhead transcription factor.  Homologues of these genes have now been implicated in regulation of human aging.[25]   These findings are also important for diabetes, since the mammalian orthologs of daf-16 (referred to as FOXO transcription factors) are also regulated by insulin. The Ruvkun lab has used full genome RNAi libraries to discover a comprehensive set of genes that regulate aging and metabolism. Many of these genes are broadly conserved in animal phylogeny and are likely to reveal the neuroendocrine system that assesses and regulates energy stores and assigns metabolic pathways based on that status.SETG: The Search for Extraterrestrial Genomes[edit]Since 2000, the Ruvkun lab in collaboration with Maria Zuber at MIT, Chris Carr (now at Georgia Tech), and Michael Finney (now a San Francisco biotech entrepreneur) has been developing protocols and instruments that can amplify and sequence DNA and RNA to search for life on another planet that is ancestrally related to the Tree of Life on Earth.  The Search for Extraterrestrial Genomes, or SETG, project has been developing a small instrument that can determine DNA sequences on Mars (or any other planetary body), and send the information in those DNA sequence files to Earth for comparison to life on Earth.Innate immune surveillance[edit]In 2012, Ruvkun made an original contribution to the field of immunology with the publication of a featured paper in the journal Cell describing an elegant mechanism for innate immune surveillance in animals that relies on the monitoring of core cellular functions in the host, which are often sabotaged by microbial toxins during the course of infection.[26]Microbial life beyond the Solar System[edit]In 2019, Ruvkun, together with Chris Carr, Mike Finney and Maria Zuber,[27] presented the argument that the appearance of sophisticated microbial life on Earth soon after it cooled, and the recent discoveries of Hot Jupiters and disruptive planetary migrations in exoplanet systems favors the spread of DNA-based microbial life across the galaxy.  The SETG project is working to have NASA send a DNA sequencer to Mars to search for life there in the hope that evidence will be uncovered that life did not arise originally on Earth, but elsewhere in the universe.[28]Published articles and recognition[edit]As of 2018, Ruvkun has published about 150 scientific articles. Ruvkun has received numerous awards for his contributions to medical science, for his contributions to the aging field[29] and to the discovery of microRNAs.[30] He is a recipient of the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research,[31] the Gairdner Foundation International Award, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science.[32] Ruvkun was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2008.Awards[edit]2005 Lewis S.

In 2018, she founded an independent research institute, the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens.[3] In 2020, Charpentier and American biochemist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a method for genome editing (through CRISPR). This was the first science Nobel Prize ever won by two women only.[4][5][6]Early life and education[edit]Born in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge in France, Charpentier studied biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University (which became the Faculty of Science of Sorbonne University) in Paris.[7] She was a graduate student at the Institut Pasteur from 1992 to 1995 and was awarded a research doctorate. Charpentier's PhD work investigated molecular mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance.[8] Her paternal grandfather was an Armenian who escaped to France during the Armenian genocide and met his wife  in Marseille.[9]Career and research[edit]The Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, GermanyCharpentier worked as a university teaching assistant at Pierre and Marie Curie University from 1993 to 1995 and as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur from 1995 to 1996. She moved to the US and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in New York from 1996 to 1997. During this time, Charpentier worked in the lab of microbiologist Elaine Tuomanen.[10] Tuomanen's lab investigated how the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae utilizes mobile genetic elements to alter its genome. Charpentier also helped to demonstrate how S. pneumoniae develops vancomycin resistance.[11]Charpentier worked as an assistant research scientist at the New York University Medical Center from 1997 to 1999. There she worked in the lab of Pamela Cowin, a skin-cell biologist interested in mammalian gene manipulation. Charpentier published a paper exploring the regulation of hair growth in mice.[12] She held the position of Research Associate at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and at the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine[13] in New York from 1999 to 2002.[7]After five years in the United States, Charpentier returned to Europe and became the lab head and a guest professor at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics, University of Vienna, from 2002 to 2004. In 2004, Charpentier published her discovery of an RNA molecule involved in the regulation of virulence-factor synthesis in Streptococcus pyogenes.[14] From 2004 to 2006 she was lab head and an assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology. In 2006 she became a privatdozentin (Microbiology) and received her habilitation at the Centre of Molecular Biology. From 2006 to 2009 she worked as lab head and associate professor at the Max F. Perutz Laboratories.[7]Charpentier moved to Sweden and became lab head and associate professor at the Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), at Ume\u00e5 University. She held the position of group leader from 2008 to 2013 and was visiting professor from 2014 to 2017.[15] She moved to Germany to act as department head and W3 Professor at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research[16] in Braunschweig and the Hannover Medical School from 2013 until 2015. In 2014 she became an Alexander von Humboldt Professor.[7]In 2015 Charpentier accepted an offer from the German Max Planck Society to become a scientific member of the society and a director at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. Since 2016, she has been an Honorary Professor at Humboldt University in Berlin; since 2018, she is the Founding and acting director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens.[7][17][18] Charpentier retained her position as visiting professor at Ume\u00e5 University until the end of 2017 when a new donation from the Kempe Foundations and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation allowed her to offer more young researchers positions within research groups of the MIMS Laboratory.[19]CRISPR/Cas9[edit]Charpentier is best known for her Nobel-winning work of deciphering the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial immune system, called CRISPR/Cas9, and repurposing it into a tool for genome editing. In particular, she uncovered a novel mechanism for the maturation of a non-coding RNA which is pivotal in the function of CRISPR/Cas9. Specifically, Charpentier demonstrated that a small RNA called tracrRNA is essential for the maturation of crRNA.[20]In 2011, Charpentier met Jennifer Doudna at a research conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and they began a collaboration.[10] Working with Doudna's laboratory, Charpentier's laboratory showed that Cas9 could be used to make cuts in any DNA sequence desired.[21][22] The method they developed involved the combination of Cas9 with easily created synthetic guide RNA molecules. Synthetic guide RNA is a chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA; therefore, this discovery demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be used to edit the genome with relative ease.[22] Researchers worldwide have employed this method successfully to edit the DNA sequences of plants, animals, and laboratory cell lines. Since its discovery, CRISPR has revolutionized genetics by allowing scientists to edit genes to probe their role in health and disease and to develop genetic therapies with the hope that it will prove safer and more effective than the first generation of gene therapies.[6]In 2013, Charpentier co-founded CRISPR Therapeutics and ERS Genomics along with Shaun Foy and Rodger Novak.[23]Awards[edit]Emmanuelle Charpentier in the Senate Chamber of York University in 2016, after giving her Gairdner Foundation International Award LectureIn 2015, Time magazine designated Charpentier one of the Time 100 most influential people in the world (together with Jennifer Doudna).[24][25] Charpentier Awards are as follows:Nobel Prize in Chemistry,[26] the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, the Gruber Foundation International Prize in Genetics, the Leibniz Prize, the Tang Prize, the Japan Prize, and the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience. She has won the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award jointly with Jennifer Doudna and Francisco Mojica.[27]2009 \u2013 Theodor K\u00f6rner Prize for Science and Culture[28]2011 \u2013 The Fernstr\u00f6m Prize for young and promising scientists[29]2014 \u2013 Alexander von Humboldt Professorship[30]2014 \u2013 The G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize for Molecular Biology (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)[31]2014 \u2013 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research[32] (shared with Jennifer Doudna)2014 \u2013 The Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award[33] (shared with Feng Zhang and Jennifer Doudna)2015 \u2013 Time 100: Pioneers[34] (shared with Jennifer Doudna)2015 \u2013 The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences[35] (shared with Jennifer Doudna)2015 \u2013 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine[36]2015 \u2013 The Ernst Jung Prize in Medicine[37]2015 \u2013 Princess of Asturias Awards (shared with Jennifer Doudna)[38]2015 \u2013 Gruber Foundation International Prize in Genetics (shared with Jennifer Doudna)[39]2015 \u2013 Carus Medal\u00a0[de], from German National Academy of Science, Leopoldina[40]2015 \u2013 Massry Prize[41]2015 \u2013 The Family Hansen Award[42]2016 \u2013 Otto Warburg Medal[43]2016 \u2013 L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Award[44]2016 \u2013 Leibniz Prize from the German Research Foundation[45]2016 \u2013 Canada Gairdner International Award (shared with Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang)[46]2016 \u2013 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize2016 \u2013 Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize (jointly with Jennifer Doudna)[47]2016 \u2013 Tang Prize (shared with Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang)[48]2016 \u2013 HFSP Nakasone Award (jointly with Jennifer Doudna)[49]2016 \u2013 Knight (Chevalier) French National Order of the Legion of Honour[50]2016 \u2013 Meyenburg Prize[51]2016 \u2013 Wilhelm Exner Medal[52]2016 \u2013 John Scott Award[53]2017 \u2013 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (jointly with Jennifer Doudna and Francisco Mojica)[54]2017 \u2013 Japan Prize (jointly with Jennifer Doudna)[55]2017 \u2013 Albany Medical Center Prize (jointly with Jennifer Doudna, Luciano Marraffini, Francisco Mojica, and Feng Zhang)[56]2017 \u2013 Pour le M\u00e9rite[57]2018 \u2013 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience (jointly with Jennifer Doudna and Virginijus \u0160ik\u0161nys)[58]2018 \u2013 Austrian Decoration for Science and Art[59]2018 \u2013 Bijvoet Medal of the Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research of Utrecht University[60]2018 \u2013 Harvey Prize (jointly with Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang)[61]2019 \u2013 Scheele Award of the Swedish Pharmaceutical Society[62]2019 \u2013 Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany[63]2020 \u2013 Wolf Prize in Medicine (jointly with Jennifer Doudna)[64]2020 \u2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (jointly with Jennifer Doudna)[4]Honorary doctorate degrees[edit]2016 \u2013 \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne[65]2016 \u2013 KU, (Catholic University) Leuven, Belgium[66]2016 \u2013 New York University (NYU)[67]2017 \u2013 Faculty of Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden[68]2017 \u2013 University of Western Ontario, London, Canada[69]2017 \u2013 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology[70]2018 \u2013 Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium[71]2018 \u2013 University of Cambridge[72]2018 \u2013 University of Manchester[73]2019 \u2013 McGill University, Canada[74]Memberships[edit]2014 \u2013 European Molecular Biology Organisation[75][76]2015 \u2013 National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina[77]2016 \u2013 Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences[78]2016 \u2013 Austrian Academy of Sciences[79]2016 \u2013 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences[80]2017 \u2013 U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Foreign Associate[81]2017 \u2013 National Academy of Technologies of France[82]2017 \u2013 French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences[83]2018 \u2013 European Academy of Sciences and Arts[84]2021 \u2013 Pontifical Academy of Sciences[85]In popular culture[edit]In 2019, Charpentier was a featured character in the play STEM FEMMES by Philadelphia theater company Applied Mechanics.[86]In 2021, Walter Isaacson detailed the story of Jennifer Doudna and her collaboration with Charpentier leading to the discovery of CRISPR/CAS-9, in the biography The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race.[87]References[edit]^ a b Abbott, Alison (2016).

Ambros (born 1953, Hanover, New Hampshire) is an American developmental biologist who discovered the first known microRNA (miRNA). He is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts.Background[edit]Ambros was born in New Hampshire. His father was a Polish war refugee and Victor grew up on a small dairy farm in Hartland, Vermont in a family of eight children, and went to school at Woodstock Union High School.[1] He received his BS in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975 and completed his PhD in 1979 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Nobel laureate David Baltimore. Ambros continued his research at MIT as the first postdoctoral fellow in the lab of future Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz. He became a faculty member at Harvard University in 1984 and moved to Dartmouth College in 1992. Ambros joined the faculty at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 2008, and currently holds the title of Silverman Professor of Natural Sciences in the program in Molecular Medicine, endowed by his former Dartmouth student, Howard Scott Silverman.Discovery of microRNA[edit]In 1993, Ambros and his co-workers Rosalind Lee and Rhonda Feinbaum reported in the journal Cell[2] that they had discovered single-stranded non-protein-coding regulatory RNA molecules in the organism C. elegans. Previous research, including work by Ambros and Horvitz,[3][4] had revealed that a gene known as lin-4 was important for normal larval development of C. elegans, a nematode often studied as a model organism. Specifically, lin-4 was responsible for the progressive repression of the protein LIN-14 during larval development of the worm; mutant worms deficient in lin-4 function had persistently high levels of LIN-14 and displayed developmental timing defects. However, the mechanism for control of LIN-14 remained unknown.Ambros and colleagues found that lin-4, unexpectedly, did not encode a regulatory protein. Instead, it gave rise to some small RNA molecules, 22 and 61 nucleotides in length, which Ambros called lin-4S (short) and lin-4L (long). Sequence analysis showed that lin-4S was part of lin-4L: lin-4L was predicted to form a stem-loop structure, with lin-4S contained in one of the arms, the 5' arm. Furthermore, Ambros, together with Gary Ruvkun (Harvard), discovered that lin-4S was partially complementary to several sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA encoding the LIN-14 protein.[5] Ambros and colleagues hypothesized that lin-4 could regulate LIN-14 through binding of lin-4S to these sequences in the lin-14 transcript in a type of antisense RNA mechanism.In 2000, another C. elegans small RNA regulatory molecule, let-7, was characterized by the Ruvkun lab [6] and found to be conserved in many species, including vertebrates.[7] These discoveries confirmed that Ambros had in fact discovered a class of small RNAs with conserved functions. These molecules are now known as microRNA. Ambros was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2007. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011.Awards[edit]2002: Newcomb Cleveland Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the most outstanding paper published in Science (co-recipient with the laboratories of David P.

Doudna was one of the first women to share a Nobel in the sciences. She received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with Emmanuelle Charpentier, for the development of a method for genome editing.[3][4] She is the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the department of chemistry and the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997.[5]Doudna graduated from Pomona College in 1985 and earned a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1989. Apart from her professorship at Berkeley, she is also founder and chair of the governance board of the Innovative Genomics Institute, which she co-founded in 2014.[6] Doudna is also a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, and an adjunct professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).[7][8][9][10]In 2012, Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes,[11][12] which has been called one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.[13] Since then, Doudna has been a leading figure in what is referred to as the CRISPR revolution for her fundamental work and leadership in developing CRISPR-mediated genome editing.[11] Dr Jennifer Doudna at the Innovative Genomics InstituteHer many other awards and fellowships include the 2000 Alan T. Waterman Award for her research on the structure of a ribozyme, as determined by X-ray crystallography[14] and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, with Charpentier.[15] She has been a co-recipient of the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2015),[16] the Tang Prize (2016),[17] the Canada Gairdner International Award (2016),[18] and the Japan Prize (2017).[19] She was named one of the Time 100 most influential people in 2015,[20] and in 2023 was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.[21]Early life and education[edit]Jennifer Doudna was born February 19, 1964, in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of Dorothy Jane (Williams) and Martin Kirk Doudna.[2][22] Her father received his PhD in English literature from the University of Michigan, and her mother held a master's degree in education.[11][12] When Doudna was seven years old, the family moved to Hawaii so her father could accept a teaching position in American literature at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.[11][12] Doudna's mother earned a second master's degree in Asian history from the university and taught history at a local community college.[11][12]Growing up in Hilo, Hawaii, Doudna was fascinated by the environmental beauty of the island and its flora and fauna. Nature built her sense of curiosity and her desire to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of life.[11][12] This was coupled with the atmosphere of intellectual pursuit that her parents encouraged at home. Her father enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with many books on popular science.[11][12] When Doudna was in the sixth grade, he gave her a copy of James Watson's 1968 book on the discovery of the structure of DNA, The Double Helix, which was a major inspiration.[23] Doudna also developed her interest in science and mathematics in school.[11][23] Even though Doudna was told that Women don't go into science, she knew that she wanted to be a scientist no matter what. Nothing said to her made her doubt it, Doudna said, When someone tells me I can't do something and I know that I can, it just makes me more resolved to do it.[24]While she attended Hilo High School, Doudna's interest in science was nurtured by her 10th-grade chemistry teacher, Ms. Jeanette Wong, whom she has routinely cited as a significant influence in sparking her nascent scientific curiosity.[23][25][26][27] A visiting lecturer on cancer cells further encouraged her pursuit of science as a career choice.[23] She spent a summer working in the University of Hawaii at Hilo lab of noted mycologist Don Hemmes and graduated from Hilo High School in 1981.[28]Doudna was an undergraduate student at Pomona College in Claremont, California, where she studied biochemistry.[11][12] During her freshman year, while taking a course in general chemistry, she questioned her own ability to pursue a career in science, and considered switching her major to French as a sophomore.[8][11] However, her French teacher suggested she stick with science.[11][8] Chemistry professors Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch at Pomona had a major impact on her.[8] She started her first scientific research in the lab of professor Sharon Panasenko.[8] She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in biochemistry in 1985.[8][29] She chose Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a PhD in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989.[5][30] Her Ph.D. dissertation was on a system that increased the efficiency of a self-replicating catalytic RNA[15] and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak.[15]Career and research[edit]After her PhD, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School.[5] From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar in Biomedical Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she worked with Thomas Cech.[5] As of 2022[update], Doudna has an h-index of 141 according to Google Scholar[10] and of 111 according to Scopus.[31]Research on ribozyme structure and function[edit]Early in her scientific career, Doudna worked to uncover the structure and biological function of RNA enzymes or ribozymes.[8] While in the Szostak lab, Doudna re-engineered the self-splicing Tetrahymena Group I catalytic intron into a true catalytic ribozyme that copied RNA templates.[8] Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlying mechanisms; however, she came to realize that not being able to see the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. Doudna went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado Boulder to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a ribozyme for the first time, so ribozyme structure could be compared with that of Enzymes, the catalytic Proteins.[8] She started this project at the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at Yale University in 1996.[15] Doudna joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.[5] Portrait of Dr Jennifer Doudna by Christopher Michel for the National AcademiesX-ray diffraction-based structure of active site of a ribozyme at Yale[edit]Shape of a self-splicing intron with two exons (shown in red and blue). DS Goodsell, 2005, PDBAt Yale, Doudna's group was able to crystallize and solve the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of the Tetrahymena Group I ribozyme.[8] They showed that a core of five magnesium ions clustered in one region of the P4-P6 domain of the ribozyme, forming a hydrophobic core around which the rest of the structure could fold.[8] This is analogous, but chemically distinct from, the way proteins typically have a core of hydrophobic amino acids.[8] Her group has crystallized other ribozymes,[15] including the Hepatitis Delta Virus ribozyme.[8] This initial work to solve large RNA structures led to further structural studies on an internal ribosome entry site(IRES) and protein-RNA complexes such as the Signal Recognition Particle.[8]Doudna was promoted to the position of Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000. In 2000\u20132001, she was Robert Burns Woodward Visiting Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University.[5]Move to Berkeley[edit]External videos CRISPR Biology and Biotechnology: The Future of Genome Editing, Jennifer Doudna delivers the 29th annual Ullyot Public Affairs Lecture, Science History InstituteIn 2002, she joined her husband, Jamie Cate, at Berkeley, accepting a position as professor of biochemistry and molecular biology.[15] Doudna also gained access to the synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for her experiments with high powered x-ray diffraction.[15]In 2009, she took a leave of absence from Berkeley to work at Genentech to lead discovery research.[32] She left Genentech after two months and returned to Berkeley with the help of colleague Michael Marletta,[33] cancelling all of her obligations to study CRISPR.[32]As of 2023, Doudna was located at the University of California, Berkeley, where she directs the Innovative Genomics Institute, a collaboration between Berkeley and UCSF founded by Doudna to develop genome editing technology and apply it to some of society's greatest problems in human health, agriculture and climate change.[34][35][36] Doudna holds the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Professorship in Biomedicine and Health, and is the chair of the Chancellor's Advisor Committee on Biology.[5] Her lab now focuses on the structure and function of CRISPR-Cas systems, developing new genome editing technology and delivery mechanisms for CRISPR therapeutics, and novel techniques for precisely editing microbiomes.[37][38][6][34]CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing discovery[edit]Doudna was introduced to CRISPR by Jillian Banfield in 2006 who had found Doudna by way of a Google search, having typed RNAi and UC Berkeley into her browser, and Doudna's name came up at the top of the list.[39][40] In 2012, Doudna and her colleagues made a new discovery that reduces the time and work needed to edit genomic DNA.[41][42] Their discovery relies on a protein named Cas9 found in the Streptococcus bacterial CRISPR immune system that cooperates with guide RNA and works like scissors. The protein attacks its prey, the DNA of viruses, and slices it up, preventing it from infecting the bacterium.[12] This system was first discovered by Yoshizumi Ishino and colleagues in 1987[43] and later characterized by Francisco Mojica,[44] but Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier showed for the first time that they could use different RNAs to program it to cut and edit different DNAs.[12]As CRISPR becomes increasingly used to edit multicellular organisms, Doudna continues to be called upon to serve as a thought-leader on the ethics of changing an organism's function using CRISPR technology.[45] Their discovery has since been further developed by many research groups[15] for applications ranging from fundamental cell biology, plant, and animal research to treatments for diseases including sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and HIV.[11][41] Doudna and several other leading biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on any clinical application of gene editing using CRISPR.[46][47] Doudna supports the usage of CRISPR in somatic gene editing, gene alterations which do not get passed to the next generation, but not germline gene editing.[48]CRISPR-Cas9 complexThe CRISPR system created a new straightforward way to edit DNA and there was a rush to patent the technique.[11] Doudna and UC Berkeley collaborators applied for a patent and so did a group at the Broad Institute affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.[49] Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute had shown that CRISPR-Cas9 could edit genes in cultured human cells a few months after Doudna and Charpentier published their method.[41] Before the UC Berkeley patent application was decided, a patent was granted to the Broad investigators and UC Berkeley filed a lawsuit against the decision.[49] In 2017, the court decided in favor of the Broad Institute, who claimed that they had initiated the research earliest and had first applied it to human cell engineering thus supporting editing in human cells with evidence but that the UC Berkeley group had only suggested this application.[49] UC Berkeley appealed on grounds that they had clearly discussed and spelled out how to do the application the Broad had pursued.[50] In September 2018, the appeals court decided in favor of the Broad Institute's patent.[51] Meanwhile, UC Berkeley and co-applicants' patent to cover the general technique was also granted.[52] To further cloud the issue, in Europe the claim of the Broad Institute, to have initiated the research first, was disallowed.[53] The rejection was due to a procedural flaw in the application involving a different set of personnel listed in the lawsuit and the patent application, leading to speculation that the UC Berkeley group would prevail in Europe.[53] Doudna cofounded Caribou Biosciences, a company to commercialize CRISPR technology, in 2011.[54] In September 2013, Doudna cofounded Editas Medicine with Zhang and others despite their legal battles, but she quit in June 2014; Charpentier then invited her to join CRISPR Therapeutics, but she declined following the divorce-like experience at Editas.[55] Doudna is also a cofounder of Caribou spin-off Intellia Therapeutics[56][57] and Scribe Therapeutics, which pioneered CasX, a more compact, next-generation Cas9 which can efficiently cut DNA.[58]In 2017, she co-authored A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution,[11] a rare case of the first-person account of a major scientific breakthrough, aimed at the general public.[59]In addition to the CRISPR breakthrough, Doudna has discovered that the hepatitis C virus utilizes an unusual strategy to synthesize viral proteins.[60] This work could lead to new drugs to stop infections without causing harm to the tissues of the body.[60]I have so much optimism about what CRISPR can do to help cure unaddressed genetic diseases and improve sustainable agriculture, but I'm also concerned that the benefits of the technology might not reach those who need it most if we're not thoughtful and deliberate about how we develop the technology, Doudna said.[24]Mammoth Biosciences[edit]In 2017, Doudna co-founded Mammoth Biosciences,[61] a San Francisco-based bioengineering tech startup. Initial funding raised $23\u00a0million,[62] with a series B round of funding in 2020 raising $45\u00a0million.[63] The business is focused on improving access to bio sensing tests which address challenges across healthcare, agriculture, environmental monitoring, biodefense, and more.[61]COVID-19 response[edit]Beginning in March 2020, Doudna organized an effort to use CRISPR-based technologies to address the COVID-19 pandemic along with Dave Savage, Robert Tjian, and other colleagues at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), where they created a testing center.[64] This center processed over 500,000 patient samples from UC Berkeley students, staff and faculty as well as members of the surrounding community and farm workers in the Salinas area.[65][66] Mammoth Biosciences announced a peer-reviewed validation of a rapid, CRISPR-based point of need COVID-19 diagnostic which is faster and less expensive than qRT-PCR based tests.[67]Personal life[edit]Doudna's first marriage was in 1988 to a fellow graduate student at Harvard named Tom Griffin, but his interests were more broad and less focused on research than hers and they divorced a few years later. Griffin wanted to move to Boulder, Colorado, where Doudna was also interested in working with Thomas Cech.[68] As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, Doudna met Jamie Cate, then a graduate student. They worked together on the project to crystallize and determine the structure of the Tetrahymena Group I intron P4-P6 catalytic region. Doudna brought Cate with her to Yale, and they married in Hawaii in 2000. Cate later became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Doudna followed him to Boston at Harvard, but in 2002 they both accepted faculty positions at Berkeley and moved there together; Cate preferred the less formal environment on the West Coast from his earlier experiences at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Doudna liked that Berkeley is a public university.[69] Cate is a Berkeley professor and works on gene-editing yeast to increase their cellulose fermentation for biofuel production. Doudna and Cate have a son born in 2002 who attends UC Berkeley, studying electrical engineering and computer science.[12]Awards and honors[edit]Main article: List of awards and honors received by Jennifer DoudnaDoudna was a Searle Scholar and received the 1996 Beckman Young Investigators Award.[70][71][72] In 2000, she was awarded the Alan T.

SilhavyMichael Nip Hall (born 12 June 1953) is an American-Swiss molecular biologist and professor at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, Switzerland.[4] He discovered TOR, a protein central for regulating cell growth.Early life and education[edit]Hall was born in Puerto Rico. His parents liked Latin American culture, so they moved to Peru when he was three years old, and then to Venezuela a few years later.[5] When Hall was 13, he went to the United States for boarding school, at St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts.[4][5]Hall entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an arts major, but switched to zoology as he wanted to study medicine,[5] earning his BSc in 1976.[2] He found out he was not attracted to medicine after working at a local hospital, and turned to research when working on his undergraduate honors thesis in a molecular genetics laboratory.[5] Hall obtained his PhD from Harvard University in 1981.[2]Career[edit]Hall has been intrigued with the research of Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod with bacterial genetics, and so he went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris as a research fellow in 1981 for eight months.[5] He then joined Ira Herskowitz's group at the University of California, San Francisco as a postdoctoral fellow. He became a principal investigator in 1984, leading his own research group.[4]In 1987, Hall moved to Basel, Switzerland, and joined the Division of Biochemistry of the Biozentrum, University of Basel, as an assistant professor.[4] He was promoted to professor in 1992.[2]Hall was twice appointed Vice Director of the Biozentrum, from 2002 to 2009 and again from 2013 to 2016.[4] He was also Chairman of the European Molecular Biology Organization Council between 2021 and 2022, and served on the Council from 2017 to 2019 and again from 2020 to 2022.[6]Currently, Hall serves on the Board of Trustees of the Louis-Jeantet Foundation.[7]Research[edit]Hall is a pioneer in the fields of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and cell growth control, and is best known for discovering mTOR. In 1991, Hall seminally discovered two genes that, when mutated, made rapamycin unable to inhibit cell growth in yeasts.[8] Hall named them TOR1 and TOR2, short for Target of Rapamycin,[9] which his group also sequenced and characterized.[10][11]Three years later, Stuart Schreiber identified the mammalian counterpart of TOR, known as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).[12] The gene and the protein it encodes are later renamed the mechanistic target of rapamycin, while the short form remains mTOR.[13]The protein encoded by the TOR (and mTOR) gene is a protein kinase activated by growth factors, nutrients, and insulin. It is a central controller of cell growth and metabolism. The TOR protein plays a key role in aging and the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.[14]After the discovery of TOR, Hall continued studying the function and regulation of TOR and mTOR in yeasts and humans. His group was the first to recognize that yeast TOR1 and TOR2 proteins can form two protein complexes (known as TORC1 and TORC2) with distinct function and composition.[15] They went on to show the mammalian counterpart of TORC2 (named mTORC2) is not inhibited by rapamycin and regulates a different signalling pathway from mTORC1.[16]Hall also identified many roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2, including ribosomes physically interact with and activate mTORC2,[17] glutamine breakdown stimulates mTORC1,[18] and mTORC2 promotes lipid synthesis and cancer.[19] Collaborating with Nenad Ban and Timm Maier, Hall reported the structures of mTORC1 in 2016[20] and mTORC2 in 2018.[21]Awards and honors[edit]Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (1995)[22]Clo\u00ebtta Prize (2003)[23]Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2009)[24]Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine (2009)[25]Marcel Benoist Prize (2012)[26]Member of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (2013)[27]Sir Hans Krebs Medal (2014)[28]Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2014)[29]Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2014)[3]Canada Gairdner International Award (2015)[30]Debrecen Award for Molecular Medicine (2016)[1]Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Prize (2017)[31]Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research (2017)[32]HFSP Nakasone Award (2019)[33]BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2019)[34]Sj\u00f6berg Prize (2020)[35]References[edit]^ a b Debrecen Award for Molecular Medicine 2016.

He works at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as the Morgan Professor of Biology. Varshavsky left Russia in 1977, emigrating to United States. His laboratory, initially at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and later at Caltech, has discovered, during the 1980s, the first degradation signals (degrons) in short-lived proteins and biological fundamentals of the ubiquitin system. His current research continues to focus on the ubiquitin system and N-degron pathways. Education and appointments[edit]Varshavsky received a B.S. degree from the Moscow University (Russia) (1970) and Ph.D. from the Institute of Molecular Biology, Moscow, Russia (1973).

During 1984-1990, the Varshavsky lab discovered biological fundamentals of the ubiquitin system.[3][4][5][6][7][8] The field of ubiquitin and regulated protein degradation was created in the 1980s through complementary discoveries, during 1978-1990, that revealed three sets of previously unknown facts. The first set of these facts (item 1 below) was discovered by the A. Hershko laboratory at the Technion (Haifa, Israel) (reviewed in ref. [9]).The other two sets (items 2 and 3 below) were discovered by the Varshavsky laboratory, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts).[3][4][5][6][7][8](1) A. Ciechanover and A. Hershko demonstrated that ubiquitin, a 76-residue protein, is covalently conjugated to other proteins in cell extracts, a novel protein modification involved in the ATP-dependent protein degradation in extracts from mammalian reticulocytes (reviewed in ref. [9]).Ubiquitylation of a test protein in a reticulocyte extract caused it to become short-lived in the extract. Hershko, Ciechanover, Rose and their colleagues also discovered that ubiquitin-protein conjugation is mediated by a cascade of enzymes, termed E1, E2 and E3. These studies were carried out using cell-free (in vitro) extracts and isolated E1-E3 enzymes.[9] At that time, in the early 1980s, physiological significance of the ubiquitin system and its specific biological functions remained unknown.(2) In 1986, the in vivo selectivity of ubiquitylation (ubiquitin-protein conjugation) was shown, by the Varshavsky lab, to be determined by degradation signals (degrons) in cellular proteins.[3][4][5][6][7][8] N-terminal degrons, called N-degrons, were the first degradation signals to be discovered. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic systems that selectively destroy proteins bearing N-degrons are called N-degron pathways. Prior to 2019, these systems were called N-end rule pathways.[3][4][5](3) During 1984-1990, the Varshavsky lab discovered that ubiquitylation has remarkably broad biological functions, to a large extent through control of the in vivo levels of cellular proteins.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Varshavsky and coworkers demonstrated in 1984 that the bulk of protein degradation in living cells requires ubiquitylation. Soon thereafter, they identified the first specific biological functions of ubiquitylation, including DNA repair (1987), the cell division cycle (1988), stress responses (1987), protein synthesis (1989), and transcriptional regulation (1990).[3][4][5][6][7][8] In addition, the Varshavsky lab identified the MATalpha2 transcriptional repressor as the first physiological substrate of the ubiquitin system (in 1990), cloned the first genes encoding ubiquitin precursors (in 1984-1989), identified the first ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes with specific biological functions (in 1987-1988), discovered a nonproteolytic function of ubiquitin (its activity as a cotranslational chaperone) (in 1989), cloned the first deubiquitylating enzymes, termed UBP1-UBP3, and cloned the first specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, termed UBR1 (in 1990). \u00a0The latter advance opened a particularly large field, since later studies showed that the human genome encodes more than 600 distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases. This multitude of E3s underlies the enormous functional range of the ubiquitin system. In addition, the Varshavsky lab discovered, in 1989, the first specific substrate-linked polyubiquitin chains, and demonstrated, in 1990, the subunit selectivity of degradation of oligomeric proteins by the ubiquitin system (references [3][4][5][6][7][8] and references therein). In sum, the complementary discoveries by the laboratories of Hershko and Varshavsky during the 1980s (items 1-3 above) yielded the modern paradigm of the central importance of protein degradation for the regulation of most proteins in vivo, on a par with the control by transcription and translation. Given the exceptionally broad functional range of the ubiquitin system and numerous ways in which ubiquitin-dependent processes can malfunction in disease, from cancer and neurodegenerative syndromes to defects in immunity and other illnesses, including birth defects, the resulting change in our understanding of biological circuits has major implications for medicine.[4][5][8][9]Varshavsky and coworkers continued their studies of the ubiquitin system in the ensuing decades (from 1990 to the present), focusing on N-degron pathways. Wide-ranging functions of these pathways include the selective destruction of misfolded proteins, the sensing of specific compounds such as oxygen, heme, short peptides and nitric oxide, the regulation of DNA transcription, replication, repair, and chromosome cohesion/segregation, the control of peptide transport, meiosis, chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, gluconeogenesis, autophagy, apoptosis, adaptive and\u00a0 innate immunity, cardiovascular development, neurogenesis, spermatogenesis, and circadian rhythms; diverse involvements in human diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and perturbations of immunity; a variety of roles in bacteria; and many functions in plants, including seed germination and oxygen/NO sensing (references [4][5][8][9][10][11][12] and references therein). Contributions outside the ubiquitin field[edit]1. The discovery, in 1978-1979, of the first nucleosome-depleted, nuclease-hypersensitive regions in chromosomes. Such \u201cexposed\u201d chromosomal segments are characteristic of transcriptional promoters, recombination hotspots, and the origins of DNA replication.[2][4]2. The discovery, in 1980-1981, of the first pathway of chromosome cohesion/segregation. It involves the formation, during DNA replication, of multiply intertwined (multicatenated) sister chromatids, and their later stepwise decatenation by type-2 DNA topoisomerases.[2][4]3. The idea, in 2007, that DNA deletions (and less frequent insertions) that are characteristic of cancer cells can be used as non-reverting cancer-specific signposts, thereby making possible a selective therapy of cancers that would be impervious to tumor progression.[12][13]4. A verifiable conjecture about molecular basis of sleep causation, termed the fragment generation (FG) hypothesis.[14] According to the FG hypothesis, a molecular cause of sleep stems from production, during wakefulness, of numerous extracellular and intracellular protein-sized protein fragments that can be transiently beneficial but can also perturb, through their diverse and cumulative effects, the functioning of the brain and other organs. The FG hypothesis posits that sleep evolved, at least in part, to counteract overproduction (owing to an insufficiently fast elimination) of hundreds of different protein fragments during wakefulness. The FG hypothesis is consistent with available experimental evidence. It remains to be verified.[14]5. Inventions of genetic and biochemical methods (1980-2017) (see references [2][4][8] and references therein): (i) A method for two-dimensional electrophoretic mapping of DNA replication/multicatenation intermediates, in 1980-1981. (ii) Nucleosome mapping using a two-dimensional hybridization method, in 1982. (iii) The ubiquitin fusion technique, in 1986. This method makes it possible to expose, in vivo, a desired N-terminal residue in a protein of interest. Owing to the mechanics of the genetic code, all nascent proteins bear the N-terminal Met residue, which is either retained in or removed from mature proteins. The ubiquitin fusion technique makes it possible to \u201cbypass\u201d the endogenous rules of N-terminal Met removal and retention. (iv) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, in 1988. Advanced versions of ChIP are being used for mapping in vivo locations of chromosomal proteins. (v) Mutations in many (most) genes that cause a hypersensitivity to heavy water (D2O), a novel and generally applicable conditional phenotype, in 1988. (vi) Heat-activated N-degron for producing temperature-sensitive mutants, in 1994. (vii) Split-ubiquitin method for detecting protein interactions in vivo, in 1994. The central idea of the split-ubiquitin technique opened the field of single-subunit split proteins, such as split-GFP, split lactamase, split Cas9 CRISPR nuclease, and many other split protein sensors and effectors. (viii) Ubiquitin translocation assay, in 1994, for analyzing, in vivo, specific mechanisms and kinetics of protein translocation across cellular membranes. (ix) Ubiquitin sandwich technique, in 2000. It uses ubiquitin fusions and multiple tandem reporters to detect and measure cotranslational proteolysis in vivo. (x) Subunit decoy technique, in 2013, for analyzing the in vivo regulation of subunit stoichiometries in oligomeric proteins. (xi) Promoter reference technique, in 2017. This reference-based method for measuring the in vivo protein degradation uses RNA aptamers and bypasses the necessity of global translation inhibitors in a chase-degradation assay.1.

He became emeritus professor of biophysics at the Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble in September 2007, and chairman of the board of the Edmond J. Safra Biomedical Research Center in 2009 at Clinatec, a multidisciplinary institute he co-founded in Grenoble that applies nanotechnologies to neurosciences.Biography[edit]Alim Louis Benabid was born May 2, 1942, in Grenoble, France. The son of a doctor from Algeria and of a French nurse, Benabid was quoted as saying he could not easily decide between studying physics or medicine.[1] He received his medical degree in 1970 and a doctorate in physics in 1978, both from Joseph Fourier University (now part of the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes) in Grenoble.[1] He became a staff neurosurgeon at Joseph Fourier University in 1972, professor of experimental medicine in 1978, and professor of biophysics from 1983 to 2007.[2] Benabid also had a fellowship in 1979 \u2013 1980 in preclinical neuropharmacology in the laboratory of Floyd Bloom at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.[3] From 1988 to 2007, he directed the preclinical neurosciences unit at the French biomedical and public health research institution INSERM, and from 1989 to 2007, served as head of the neurosurgery department at the University Hospital of Grenoble.[2] In other roles, Benabid coordinated the Claudio Munari Center for Surgery of Epilepsy and Movement Disorders at Ospedale (Hospital) Niguarda in Milan, Italy from 1998 to 2007, and was a staff consultant at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio from 2000 to 2003.[3]In 2007, Benabid joined the French Commissariat d'Energie Atomique as a scientific adviser during the time a campus for public-private innovation was being created, the Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies campus, which includes the Minatec research complex and the life-science cluster NanoBio.[4][5][6] In 2009, he became chairman of the board of the Edmond J. Safra Biomedical Research Center at Clinatec, a translational biomedical technology organization he helped found within Minatec. Clinatec was jointly created by CEA-LETI (Laboratoire d'\u00e9lectronique des technologies de l'information\u2014an applied micro- and nanotechnology subsidiary of CEA), Grenoble University Hospital, INSERM and Joseph Fourier University.[7][8][9]In 2013, when awarding Benabid a $100,000 Robert A. Pritzker Prize for Leadership in Parkinson's Research to fund continued research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation said in its award announcement that Benabid had published 523 scientific papers, achieving an H Index of 67, as well as given 18 honorary lectures, and received 23 medals and prizes.[3]Deep brain stimulation neurosurgery[edit]Benabid developed stereotactic surgery methods for brain surgery in patients who had brain tumors or certain types of movement disorder.[2]As part of the work, he and his team members created tissue banks using tissue from brain tumor biopsies. The tissue samples were used to characterize brain tumors by oncogenic mapping. Studies of genomics and proteomics have highlighted the factors involved in tumor progression and led to therapeutic advances such as anti-angiogenic factors.[2]For patients with Parkinson's disease, Benabid and Pierre Pollak, a neurologist at the University Hospital of Grenoble, also developed deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 1987.[1][10][11]Parkinson's disease is commonly treated with medicines such as levodopa to improve muscle control, balance and walking, but higher dosages tend to be needed over time in this progressive neurological condition, and long-term use can lead to motor fluctuations such as tremor, rigidity or slowness.[12]Prior to development of DBS, the main surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease was lesioning to inhibit involuntary abnormal motion associated with severe Parkinson's disease not controlled by optimal medication.[9] As described in a 2010 interview with Benabid in the medical journal Lancet,[1] electrical stimulation was used during surgery to locate the ablation target and predict lesioning effects. To precisely locate the right area, an electrode would be placed around the target and those surrounding areas stimulated with physiological frequencies of 20 \u2013 50\u00a0Hz while observing the patient's movement. Since electrical stimulation itself sometimes seemed to quiet tremor during the procedure, Benabid reasoned this might be a solution. He tested from very low frequencies of 1, 5, 10\u00a0Hz and more up to 100\u00a0Hz, which mimicked effects of ablation without destroying tissue. Initially the thalamus was stimulated. Later animal studies indicated the subthalamic nucleus might be a more effective stimulation target. As technology advanced to allow such stimulation to be continuously applied for a long time, DBS became widely adopted in the 1990s for treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.[1][13]A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials published in 2014 showed that in 1,184 study subjects, DBS significantly improved untreated motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, permitting a reduction in medication doses and their associated complications; as well as contributing moderately, during the phase when the patients were taking Parkinson's disease medication, to fewer motor symptoms, greater function, and more quality of life.[14]Honors and awards[edit]Benabid has received a number of awards and honors from various countries, including:[2][3][15][16]Dehomag prize for robotics (1993)Prix \u00c9lectricit\u00e9-Sant\u00e9 de l'EDF (1994)Medicine and biology prize of the Comit\u00e9 du rayonnement fran\u00e7ais (1997)Biomedical PCL research prize of the French Academy of Sciences (1998)Scientific prize from the National Foundation for Health Promotion and Research Development (Algeria, 1999)Jean Valade Prize of the Foundation of France (1999)Member of the Institut Universitaire de France (1999)Klaus Joachim Z\u00fclch Prize of the Gertrud Reemtsma Foundation (Cologne, 2000)Scientific Award 2000 of the International Neurobionics Foundation (Hanover, 2000)Cotzias Award of the Spanish Society of Neurology\u00a0[es] (Barcelona, 2000)Sherrington Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine (London, 2002)Research and Health Prize of l'Institut des sciences et de la sant\u00e9 (2002)Betty and David Koetser Foundation Prize (Zurich, 2002)Dingebauer Prize of the German Neurological Society\u00a0[de] (2002)Member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium\u00a0[fr] (2002)[17]Spiegel and Wycis Medal (2005)Matmut Prize for medical innovation, the Foundation of the Future (2006)James Parkinson Award (2007)Victor Horsley Award (2007)American Academy of Neurology's Movement Disorders Research Award (2008)Honor Award from INSERM (2008)Victory of Medicine (2008) under the Jubilee Hospital, with Dr. Pierre PollakRobert A.

DeLong is an American neurologist and professor at the Medical School of Emory University. His research has advanced the understanding and treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor and other neurological movement disorders.DeLong attended Stanford University (AB 1962), Harvard Medical School (MD 1966), completed his internship at Boston City Hospital and his residency training at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and subsequently joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University.  Since 1990, he has been a member of the faculty at Emory University, where he has been the William Patterson Timmie Professor of Neurology since 1993. He is a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiative.In 1968, DeLong began five years of research training in the laboratory of Edward Evarts at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1971, he and Russell T. Richardson did experiments with monkeys to find out first groups of neurons (nucleus basalis), which are involved in the pathogenesis conditioned learning and they revealed the role played by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.[1]At the NIH, DeLong recorded the reactions of single brain cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia.  At that time, it was known that the basal ganglia were involved in movement, and were the part of the brain most significantly affected in Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, little was known about how the basal ganglia affected movement, or how disease of the basal ganglia caused the movement disorders seen in Parkinson's disease. In meticulous experiments over several years, DeLong measured the firing of specific cells in the basal ganglia of awake monkeys when they performed specific trained movements.Based on this work, and the work of others, DeLong and his colleagues identified a series of separate circuits that connect the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. These circuits allow parallel processing of emotions, thoughts, and movement.In the 1980s, DeLong and his colleagues began to study monkeys with an experimentally-induced disease much like Parkinson\u2019s disease. He discovered that neurons in a part of the basal ganglia called the subthalamic nucleus were firing excessively, and that destroying (ablating) the subthalamic nucleus greatly improved the symptoms.Shortly thereafter, neurosurgeon Alim-Louis Benabid discovered that the same improvement could be achieved by placing a wire into the subthalamic nucleus, connecting it to a battery and delivering an adjustable high-frequency stimulation to the tip of the wire\u2014a technique called deep brain stimulation. Today, this technique is used to improve symptoms and the quality of life in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease who are not responding adequately to pharmacologic treatment. Ablation or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has transformed the lives of many people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.For his work in understanding the circuits connecting the basal ganglia to other parts of the brain, and in applying that knowledge to develop a technique that has eased the suffering of many people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, DeLong was honored in 2014 with the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[2]The same accomplishments were recognized by his receipt (with Benabid) of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award.[3]References[edit]^ z.B.

The experience attracted him to research, and he went to Indiana University Bloomington for graduate studies.[6] He graduated with an MSc in 1975 and a PhD three years later, under the supervision of Anthony Mahowald.[4][6]Career[edit]Allis undertook a postdoctoral fellowship in the University of Rochester after obtaining his PhD.[6] In 1981, he joined the Baylor College of Medicine as an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Department of Cell Biology, and was promoted to associate professor in 1986 and full professor in 1989.[4] He joined the Department of Biology at Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences in 1990.[7]Allis returned to the University of Rochester in 1995, and became the Marie Curran Wilson and Joseph Chamberlain Wilson Professor of Biology two years later.[8] In 1998, Allis went to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.[9] He joined the Rockefeller University in 2003 as the Joy and Jack Fishman Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics.[4]Allis had been treated for cancer.[3] He died January 8, 2023, at a hospital in Seattle, Washington.[3]Research[edit]Scholia has a profile for Charles David Allis (Q1064064).Allis was known for his research of histone modifications and their relation to chromatin structure. He started working on Tetrahymena, a ciliated unicellular eukaryote. Tetrahymena is an ideal candidate to study histone acetylation due to its dual nucleus. It has a larger macronucleus that is transcriptionally active and somatic, and a smaller micronucleus that is transcriptionally silent and germline.[10] Chromatin biology at the time was not a popular topic; nor was the use of ciliated organisms.[6]In 1996, his group isolated the histone acetyltransferase p55 from Tetrahymena, an enzyme that acetylates histones, and found the enzyme was homologous to Gcn5p, a known transcriptional co-activator in yeast.[11][12] This was the first time that histone acetyltransferases were connected to DNA transcription activation,[13] verifying Vincent Allfrey's hypothesis in the 1960s that histone acetylation regulates transcription.[14][15]Following this seminal report, Allis continued studying histone acetylation, discovering more histone acetyltransferases, including TAF1 (part of the transcription factor TFIID needed to initiate transcription).[16] Allis also branched off to researching histone phosphorylation and histone methylation. He linked histone phosphorylation to mitosis and mitogen stimulation,[17][18] and established a synergistic relationship between histone phosphorylation and acetylation.[19] He also determined the role of methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3,[20] identified SET domain-containing proteins as histone methyltransferase,[21] and found that histone ubiquitylation regulates histone methylation.[22]In 2000, Allis and Brian Strahl proposed the histone code hypothesis, which states that DNA transcription is largely regulated by histone modifications.[23] Later, Allis (together with Thomas Jenuwein) explicitly associated the histone code with epigenetics,[24] and recognized the clinical significance of histone modifications, especially in cancers.[25][26]In more recent years, his attention turned to oncohistones, which are histones with mutations that distort normal histone modifications, leading to cancers.[27][28]Honors and awards[edit]Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001)[29]Dickson Prize in Medicine (2002)[30]Massry Prize (2003)[31]Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences (2004)[32]Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2005)[33]Distinguished Alumnus Award, University of Cincinnati College of Arts and Sciences (2007)[34]Gairdner Foundation International Award (2007)[35]American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Merck Award (2008)[36]Lewis S.

These studies now form the paradigm for modern cancer research and provided the basis for the notion of the somatic evolution of cancer.Research[edit]In the 1980s, Vogelstein developed new experimental approaches to study human tumors.[5] His studies of various stages of colorectal cancers led him to propose a specific model for human tumorigenesis in 1988. In particular, he suggested that cancer is caused by sequential mutations of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.[6][7][8]The first tumor suppressor gene validating this hypothesis was that encoding p53. The p53 protein was discovered 10 years earlier by several groups, including that of David Lane and Lionel Crawford, Arnold Levine, and Lloyd Old. But there was no evidence that p53 played a major role in human cancers, and the gene encoding p53 (TP53) was thought to be an oncogene rather than a tumor suppressor gene. In 1989, Vogelstein and his students discovered that TP53 not only played a role in human tumorigenesis, but that it was a common denominator of human tumors, mutated in the majority of them.[9][10] He then discovered the mechanism through which TP53 suppresses tumorigenesis. Prior to these studies, the only biochemical function attributed to p53 was its binding to heat shock proteins. Vogelstein and his colleagues demonstrated that p53 had a much more specific activity: it bound DNA in a sequence-specific manner. They precisely defined its consensus recognition sequence and showed that virtually all p53 mutations found in tumors resulted in loss of the sequence-specific transcriptional activation properties of p53.[11][12] They subsequently discovered genes that are directly activated by p53 to control cell birth and cell death.[13][14] His group's more recent studies examining the entire compendium of human genes have shown that the TP53 gene is more frequently mutated in cancers than any other gene .[15][16][12][17][18][19]In 1991, Vogelstein and long-time colleague Kenneth W. Kinzler, working with Yusuke Nakamura in Japan, discovered another tumor suppressor gene. This gene, called APC, was responsible for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a syndrome associated with the development of numerous small benign tumors, some of which progress to cancer.[20][21] This gene was independently discovered by Ray White's group at the University of Utah. Vogelstein and Kinzler subsequently showed that non-hereditary (somatic) mutations of APC initiate most cases of colon and rectal cancers. They also showed how APC functions \u2013 through binding to beta-catenin and stimulating its degradation.[22][23]Vogelstein and Kinzler worked with Albert de la Chapelle and Lauri Aaltonen at the U. Helsinki to identify the genes responsible for Hereditary NonPolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), the other major form of heritable colorectal tumorigenesis. They were the first to localize one of the major causative genes to a specific chromosomal locus through linkage studies. This localization soon led them and other groups to identify repair genes such as MSH2 and MLH1 that are responsible for most cases of this syndrome.[24][25][26][27]In the early 2000s, Vogelstein and Kinzler, working with Victor Velculescu, Aman Amer Zakar, Mustak Akbar Zakar, Bishwas Banerjee, Carmen Flohlar, Couleen Mathers, Farheen Zuber Mohmed Patel, Nicholas Papadopoulos, and others in their group, began to perform large scale experiments to identify mutations throughout the genome. They were to perform exomic sequencing, meaning determination of the sequence of every protein-encoding gene in the human genome. The first analyzed tumors included those of the colon, breast, pancreas, and brain. These studies outlined the landscapes of human cancer genomes, later confirmed by massively parallel sequencing of many different tumor types by laboratories throughout the world.[28] In the process of analyzing all the protein-encoding genes within cancers, Vogelstein and his colleagues discovered several novel genes that play important roles in cancer, such as PIK3CA,[29] IDH1,[30] IDH2,[30] ARID1A,[31] ARID2, ATRX,[32] DAXX,[32] MLL2, MLL3, CIC, and RNF43.[33][34][35][36]Vogelstein pioneered the idea that somatic mutations represent uniquely specific biomarkers for cancer, creating the field now called liquid biopsies. Working with post-doctoral fellow David Sidransky in the early 1990s, he showed that such somatic mutations were detectable in the stool of colorectal cancer patients and the urine of bladder cancer patients.[37][38] For this purpose, they developed Digital PCR in which DNA molecules are examined one-by-one to determine whether they are normal or mutated.[39] One of the techniques they invented for Digital PCR is called BEAMing, in which the PCR is carried out on magnetic beads in water-in-oil emulsions.[40] BEAMing is now one of the core technologies used in some next-generation, massively parallel sequencing instruments. More recently, they developed a digital-PCR based technique called SafeSeqS, in which every DNA template molecule is recognized by a unique molecular barcode. SafeSeqS dramatically enhances the ability to identify rare variants among DNA sequences, allowing such variants to be detected when they are present in only 1 in more than 10,000 total DNA molecules.[41][42][43][44][45]In mid-2019, Vogelstein started collaborating with the group of Martin Nowak at Harvard University. Together with their groups, they developed mathematical models to explain the evolution of resistance against targeted therapies.[46] They showed that the sequential administration of multiple targeted drugs precludes any chance for cure \u2014 even when there are no possible mutations that can confer cross-resistance to both drugs.  Thus, simultaneous combination of targeted therapies (as opposed to sequential) is the preferred strategy as there is at least a potential for cure.[47]Citations[edit]Vogelstein has published nearly 600 scientific papers. Vogelstein's research papers have been cited over 430,000 times.[48]In 2016 Semantic Scholar AI program included Vogelstein on its list of top ten most influential biomedical researchers.[49]Awards[edit]1990 \u2013 The Bristol Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research [50]1992 \u2013 The Young Investigator Award from the American Federation for Clinical Research, now the American Federation for Medical Research1992 \u2013 The Gairdner Foundation International Award in Science [51]1992 \u2013 The American Cancer Society Medal of Honor1993 \u2013 The Shacknai Memorial Prize from the Hebrew University[52]1993 \u2013 The Pezcoller Foundation Award from the American Association for Cancer Research[53]1993 \u2013 The Richard Lounsbery Award from the National Academy of Sciences[54]1993 \u2013 The Baxter Award from the Association of American Medical Colleges[55]1994 \u2013 The Dickson Prize from the University of Pittsburgh1994 \u2013 The Ernst Schering Prize[56]1994 \u2013 The Passano Award from the Passano Foundation[57]1994 \u2013 The Howard Taylor Ricketts Award from the University of Chicago[58]1995 \u2013 The David A.

He is one of the eight Institute Professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[3]He was formerly the Germeshausen Professor of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and maintains activity in the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. He is also a faculty member of the Harvard\u2013MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.Langer holds over 1,400 granted or pending patents.[4] He is one of the world's most highly cited researchers and his h-index is now (according to Google Scholar, 2023-09-16) 320 with currently over 413,000 citations.[5] He is a widely recognized and cited researcher in biotechnology, especially in the fields of drug delivery systems and tissue engineering.[4][6][7]He is the most cited engineer in history[8] and 4th most cited individual in any field,[9] having authored over 1,500 scientific papers. Langer is also a prolific businessman, having been behind the participation in the founding of over 40 biotechnology companies  including the well-known American pharmaceutical company, Moderna.Langer's research laboratory at MIT is the largest biomedical engineering lab in the world; maintaining over $10 million in annual grants and over 100 researchers.[10]  He has been awarded numerous leading prizes in recognition of his work.Background and personal life[edit]This section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.

He earned his Sc.D. in chemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974. His dissertation was entitled Enzymatic regeneration of ATP and completed under the direction of Clark K. Colton. From 1974\u20131977 he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Children's Hospital Boston and at Harvard Medical School under Judah Folkman.[11]Contributions to medicine and biotechnology[edit]Langer is widely regarded for his contributions to medicine and biotechnology.[12] He is considered a pioneer of many new technologies, including controlled release systems and transdermal delivery systems, which allow the administration of drugs or extraction of analytes from the body through the skin without needles or other invasive methods.[13][14][15]Langer worked with Judah Folkman at Boston Children's Hospital to isolate the first angiogenesis inhibitor, a macromolecule to block the spread of blood vessels in tumors.[12][16] Macromolecules tend to be broken down by digestion and blocked by body tissues if they are injected or inhaled, so finding a delivery system for them is difficult. Langer's idea was to encapsulate the angiogenesis inhibitor in a noninflammatory synthetic polymer system that could be implanted in the tumor and control the release of the inhibitor. He eventually invented polymer systems that would work. This discovery is considered to lay the foundation for much of today's drug delivery technology.[12][17]Langer also worked with Henry Brem of the Johns Hopkins University Medical School on a drug-delivery system for the treatment of brain cancer, to deliver chemotherapy directly to a tumor site. The wafer implants that he and his teams have designed have become increasingly more sophisticated, and can now deliver multiple drugs, and respond to stimuli.[18] In 2019, he and his team developed and patented a technique whereby microneedle tattoo patches could be used to label people with invisible ink to store medical information subcutaneously. This was presented as a boon to developing nations where lack of infrastructure means an absence of medical records.[19][20] The technology uses a quantum dot dye that is delivered, along with a vaccine, by a microneedle patch.[19]Langer is regarded as the founder of tissue engineering in regenerative medicine.[21] He and the researchers in his lab have made advances in tissue engineering, such as the creation of engineered blood vessels and vascularized engineered muscle tissue.[22][23]  Bioengineered synthetic polymers provide a scaffolding on which new skin, muscle, bone, and entire organs can be grown. With such a substrate in place, victims of serious accidents or birth defects could more easily grow missing tissue.[18][24] Such polymers can be biocompatible and biodegradable.[25]Langer is involved in several projects related to diabetes.[26] Alongside Daniel G. Anderson, he has contributed bioengineering work to a project involving teams from MIT, Harvard University and other institutions, to produce an implantable device to treat type 1 diabetes by shielding insulin-producing beta cells from immune system attacks.[27][28] He is also part of a team at MIT that have developed a drug capsule that could be used to deliver oral doses of insulin to people with type 1 diabetes.[29][30]Awards and honors[edit]Langer is the youngest person in history (at 43) to be elected to all three American science academies: the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine.

He is also the director of the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) scientific advisory council. He has a longstanding interest in mechanisms of T-cell development and activation, the development of novel strategies for tumor immunotherapy, and is recognized as one of the first people to isolate the T-cell antigen receptor complex protein.[5][6]In 2014, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences; in 2018, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Tasuku Honjo.[7][8]Early life[edit]Allison was born on August 7, 1948, in Alice, Texas, the youngest of three sons of Constance Kalula (Lynn) and Albert Murphy Allison.[9] He was inspired by his eighth-grade math teacher to pursue a career in science, spending a summer in a National Science Foundation\u2013funded summer science-training program at the University of Texas, Austin, and completing high-school biology by correspondence course at Alice High School.[10][11] Allison earned a Bachelor of Science degree in microbiology from University of Texas, Austin, in 1969, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He earned his doctor of philosophy degree in biological science in 1973, also from UT Austin, as a student of G. Barrie Kitto.[12][13]Career[edit]From 1974 to 1977, Allison worked as postdoctoral fellow at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in California. Then he worked as assistant biochemist and assistant professor at MD Anderson to 1984.[14] He was appointed a professor of immunology and director of the Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 and was concurrently appointed professor at the University of California, San Francisco from 1997.[15]In 2004, he moved to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City to become the director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and the chair of the immunology program as well as the Koch chair in immunologic studies and attending immunologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was a professor of Weill Cornell Medicine and co-chair of the Department of Graduate Program in Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences from 2004 to 2012, and also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator until 2012, when he left to join the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012. Since 2012 he has been chair of immunology at M.D. Anderson.[14]He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine), and is a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is director of the Cancer Research Institute scientific advisory council. Previously, he served as president of the American Association of Immunologists.[citation needed] He is on the Research Advisory Board of Candel Therapeutics[16] and Lytix Biopharma.[17]Allison serves as a commentator in the Cancer documentary.Research[edit]Cancer Therapy by Inhibition of Negative Immune Regulation (CTLA4, PD1)Allison trained at Scripps Research under tumor-immunologist Ralph Reisfeld, Ph.D., professor emeritus, researching human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and T-cells and exploring the role HLA proteins play in enabling the immune system to distinguish self from invaders. In 1977, Allison and a colleague, G. N. Callahan, reported in a letter to Nature that they had found evidence that the immune system was prevented from attacking cancer cells due to antigens\u2019 association with additional proteins. Finding the factors that inhibited the immune attack on cancer has been key to developing checkpoint-blockade cancer immunotherapies.[15]In 1982, Allison first discovered the T-cell receptor.[18] Allison's research to elucidate mechanisms of T-cell responses was conducted in the 1990s at the University of California, Berkeley.[19][20] In the early 1990s, Jim Allison showed that CTLA-4 acts as an inhibitory molecule to restrict T-cell responses. In 1996, Allison was the first to show that antibody blockade of a T-cell inhibitory molecule (known as CTLA-4) could lead to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and tumor rejection.This concept of blocking T-cell inhibitory pathways as a way of unleashing anti-tumor immune responses and eliciting clinical benefit laid the foundation for the development of other drugs that target T-cell inhibitory pathways, which have been labeled as immune checkpoint therapies.[10] This work ultimately led to the clinical development of ipilimumab (Yervoy), which was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.[21]Allison's research is in molecular immunology of the T-cell antigen receptor complex, co-stimulatory receptors, and other molecules involved in T-cell activation. He is particularly interested in finding signals that lead to differentiation of naive T-cells and also those that determine whether antigen receptor engagement will lead to functional activation or inactivation of T-cells. Once defined, the basic studies are used to develop new strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and immunotherapy of cancer. Most recently he has been interested in understanding the immune responses in cancer patients who respond to immunotherapy. He established the immunotherapy platform at MD Anderson Cancer Center to study immune responses in cancer patients.[22]Honors[edit]According to a quantitative analysis, Allison was the top-ranking recipient of the most prestigious international science awards in the period 2010\u20132019, having received 13 of the top 40 such awards in any field of science.[23]In 2011 Allison won the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award for Biotechnology and Medicine[24] and was awarded the American Association of Immunologists Lifetime Achievement Award.[25] In 2013 he shared the Novartis Prize for Clinical Immunology. In 2014 he shared the first Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science with Tasuku Honjo,[1] won the 9th Annual Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research of the National Foundation for Cancer Research, received the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Canada Gairdner International Award,[26] the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize,[27] the Massry Prize[28] and the Harvey Prize[29] of the Technion Institute of Technology in Haifa. In 2015, he received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award.[2] and Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize.[30]In 2017 he received the Wolf Prize in Medicine,[31] the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize[32] and the Balzan Prize for Immunological Approaches in Cancer Therapy (this prize jointly with Robert D. Schreiber).[33] In 2018 he received the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine,[34] the Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal and the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research.[35]He, along with Tasuku Honjo, was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018 for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.[36][37][38]He is the subject of the 2019 documentary film Jim Allison: Breakthrough directed by Bill Haney.[39] Allison received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2019.[40]Personal life[edit]Allison married Malinda Bell in 1969.  They have one son, Robert Allison, born in 1990, who is, as of 2018, an architect in New York City.  Allison and Malinda lived separate lives for many years and eventually divorced in 2012. Allison met Padmanee Sharma, MD, PhD through Dr. Lloyd Old in 2004. Allison and Sharma became collaborators and friends and married 10 years later in 2014. Allison is stepfather to Thalia Sharma Persaud, Avani Sharma Persaud and Kalyani Sharma Persaud.[41]Allison's mother died of lymphoma[15] when he was 10. His brother died of prostate cancer in 2005.He plays the harmonica for a blues band of immunologists and oncologists called the Checkpoints. He also plays with a local band called the Checkmates.[41]References[edit]^ a b First Tang Prize for Biopharmaceutical Science Awarded to James P.

Yamanaka is also a past president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).He received the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the biomedicine category, the 2011 Wolf Prize in Medicine with Rudolf Jaenisch,[7] and the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize together with Linus Torvalds. In 2012, he and John Gurdon were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells.[8] In 2013, he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work.Education[edit]Yamanaka was born in Higashi\u014dsaka, Japan, in 1962. After graduating from Tenn\u014dji High School attached to Osaka Kyoiku University, he received his M.D. degree at Kobe University in 1987 and his Ph.D. degree at Osaka City University, Graduate School of Medicine in 1993. After this, he went through a residency in orthopedic surgery at National Osaka Hospital and a postdoctoral fellowship at the  Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco.Afterwards, he worked at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, US, and Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. Yamanaka is currently a professor and the director emeritus of Center for iPS Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University.[6] He is also a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes.[8][9]Professional career[edit]Between 1987 and 1989, Yamanaka was a resident in orthopedic surgery at the National Osaka Hospital. His first operation was to remove a benign tumor from his friend Shuichi Hirata, a task he could not complete after one hour when a skilled surgeon would have taken ten minutes or so. Some seniors referred to him as Jamanaka, a pun on the Japanese word for obstacle.[10]From 1993 to 1996, he was at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease. Between 1996 and 1999, he was an assistant professor at Osaka City University Medical School, but found himself mostly looking after mice in the laboratory, not doing actual research.[10]His wife advised him to become a practicing doctor, but instead he applied for a position at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. He stated that he could and would clarify the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, and this can-do attitude won him the job. From 1999\u20132003, he was an associate professor there, and started the research that would later win him the 2012 Nobel Prize. He became a full professor and remained at the institute in that position from 2003\u20132005. Between 2004 and 2010, Yamanaka was a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.[11] Between 2010-2022, Yamanaka was the director and a professor at the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University.[6] In April 2022, he stepped down and took place of the director emeritus of CiRA keeping with professor position.[6][12]In 2006, he and his team generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from adult mouse fibroblasts.[2] iPS cells closely resemble embryonic stem cells, the in vitro equivalent of the part of the blastocyst (the embryo a few days after fertilization) which grows to become the embryo proper. They could show that his iPS cells were pluripotent, i.e. capable of generating all cell lineages of the body. Later he and his team generated iPS cells from human adult fibroblasts,[3] again as the first group to do so. A key difference from previous attempts by the field was his team's use of multiple transcription factors, instead of transfecting one transcription factor per experiment. They started with 24 transcription factors known to be important in the early embryo, but could in the end reduce it to 4 transcription factors \u2013 Sox2, Oct4, Klf4 and c-Myc.[2]Yamanaka's Nobel Prize\u2013winning research in iPS cells[edit]The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.[8]Background-different cell types[edit]There are different types of stem cells. This article may contain excessive or irrelevant examples. Please help improve the article by adding descriptive text and removing less pertinent examples. (May 2016) These are some types of cells that will help in understanding the material.Cell typesCharacteristicsTotipotent cellsCan give rise to all other cell types. Totipotency remains through the first few cell divisions, e.g. the fertilised egg.Pluripotent cellsCan develop into all cell types (except those that form the amniotic sac and the placenta). For example, the early embryo consists mainly of pluripotent stem cells.Multipotent cellsCan develop into any of a family of closely related cell types. For example, blood multipotent cells can develop into various blood cells.Background-different stem cell techniques[edit]TypeProsConsSomatic cell replication Embryonic Stem (ES) cellNo immune rejectionTheoretically patient-specific transplantations possible No case of successMany human egg cells neededEthical issue: Can clone humansFertilized egg ES cellPluripotentMuch research doneImmune rejection reducible via stem cell bank Fertilized egg usageImmune rejectionOncogenic potential(can't use for clinical trial)Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) CellNo ethical issuePluripotent Oncogenic potentialAbnormal agingAdult stem cellMuch researchNo immune rejectionSafe (clinical trials) Not as much differentiation potential as ES cellHistorical background[edit]The prevalent view during the early 20th century was that mature cells were permanently locked into the differentiated state and cannot return to a fully immature, pluripotent stem cell state. It was thought that cellular differentiation can only be a unidirectional process. Therefore, non-differentiated egg/early embryo cells can only develop into specialized cells. However, stem cells with limited potency (adult stem cells) remain in bone marrow, intestine, skin etc. to act as a source of cell replacement.[13]The fact that differentiated cell types had specific patterns of proteins suggested irreversible epigenetic modifications or genetic alterations to be the cause of unidirectional cell differentiation. So, cells progressively become more restricted in the differentiation potential and eventually lose pluripotency.[13]In 1962, John B. Gurdon demonstrated that the nucleus from a differentiated frog intestinal epithelial cell can generate a fully functional tadpole via transplantation to an enucleated egg. Gurdon used somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) as a method to understand reprogramming and how cells change in specialization. He concluded that differentiated somatic cell nuclei had the potential to revert to pluripotency. This was a paradigm shift at the time. It showed that a differentiated cell nucleus has retained the capacity to successfully revert to an undifferentiated state, with the potential to restart development (pluripotent capacity).However, the question still remained whether an intact differentiated cell could be fully reprogrammed to become pluripotent.Yamanaka's research[edit]Shinya Yamanaka proved that introduction of a small set of transcription factors into a differentiated cell was sufficient to revert the cell to a pluripotent state. Yamanaka focused on factors that are important for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. This was the first time an intact differentiated somatic cell could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent. Knowing that transcription factors were involved in the maintenance of the pluripotent state, he selected a set of 24 ES cell transcriptional factors as candidates to reinstate pluripotency in somatic cells. First, he collected the 24 candidate factors. When all 24 genes encoding these transcription factors were introduced into skin fibroblasts, few actually generated colonies that were remarkably similar to ES cells.Secondly, further experiments were conducted with smaller numbers of transcription factors added to identify the key factors, through a very simple and yet sensitive assay system.Lastly, he identified the four key genes. They found that 4 transcriptional factors (Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4) were sufficient to convert mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells (capable of producing teratomas in vivo and contributing to chimeric mice).These pluripotent cells are called iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells; they appeared with very low frequency. iPS cells can be selected by inserting the b-geo gene into the Fbx15 locus. The Fbx15 promoter is active in pluripotent stem cells which induce b-geo expression, which in turn gives rise to G418 resistance; this resistance helps us identify the iPS cells in culture.Moreover, in 2007, Yamanaka and his colleagues found iPS cells with germline transmission (via selecting for Oct4 or Nanog gene). Also in 2007, they were the first to produce human iPS cells.Some issues that current methods of induced pluripotency face are the very low production rate of iPS cells and the fact that the 4 transcriptional factors are shown to be oncogenic.In July 2014, during a scandal involving Japanese stem cell researcher Haruko Obokata fabricating data, doctoring images, and plagiarizing the work of others, Yamanaka faced public scrutiny for his associated work lacking full documentation. Yamanaka denied manipulating images in his papers on embryonic mouse stem cells, but he could not find lab notes to confirm that the raw data was consistent with the published results.[14][15][16]Further research and future prospects[edit]Since the original discovery by Yamanaka, much further research has been done in this field, and many improvements have been made to the technology. Improvements made to Yamanaka's research as well as future prospects of his findings are as follows:The delivery mechanism of pluripotency factors has been improved. At first retroviral vectors, that integrate randomly in the genome and cause deregulation of genes that contribute to tumor formation, were used. However, now, non-integrating viruses, stabilised RNAs or proteins, or episomal plasmids (integration-free delivery mechanism) are used.Transcription factors required for inducing pluripotency in different cell types have been identified (e.g. neural stem cells).Small substitutive molecules were identified, that can substitute for the function of the transcription factors.Transdifferentiation experiments were carried out. They tried to change the cell fate without proceeding through a pluripotent state. They were able to systematically identify genes that carry out transdifferentiation using combinations of transcription factors that induce cell fate switches. They found trandifferentiation within germ layer and between germ layers, e.g.,  exocrine cells to endocrine cells, fibroblast cells to myoblast cells, fibroblast cells to cardiomyocyte cells, fibroblast cells to neuronsCell replacement therapy with iPS cells is a possibility. Stem cells can replace diseased or lost cells in degenerative disorders and they are less prone to immune rejection. However, there is a danger that it may introduce mutations or other genomic abnormalities that render it unsuitable for cell therapy. So, there are still many challenges, but it is a very exciting and promising research area. Further work is required to guarantee safety for patients.Can medically use iPS cells from patients with genetic and other disorders to gain insights into the disease process. \t- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Rett syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia and glycogen storage disease type 1A.  \t- For cardiovascular disease, Timothy syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, type 1 and 2 long QT syndrome \t- Alzheimer\u2019s, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington\u2019s etc.iPS cells provide screening platforms for development and validation of therapeutic compounds. For example, kinetin was a novel compound found in iPS cells from familial dysautonomia and beta blockers & ion channel blockers for long QT syndrome were identified with iPS cells.Yamanaka's research has opened a new door and the world's scientists have set forth on a long journey of exploration, hoping to find our cells\u2019 true potential.[17]In 2013, iPS cells were used to generate a human vascularized and functional liver in mice in Japan. Multiple stem cells were used to differentiate the component parts of the liver, which then self-organized into the complex structure. When placed into a mouse host, the liver vessels connected to the hosts vessels and performed normal liver functions, including breaking down of drugs and liver secretions.[18]In 2022, Yamanaka factors were shown to effect age related measures in aged mice.[19]Recognition[edit]In 2007, Yamanaka was recognized as a Person Who Mattered in the Time Person of the Year edition of Time Magazine.[20] Yamanaka was also nominated as a 2008 Time 100 Finalist.[21] In June 2010, Yamanaka was awarded the Kyoto Prize for reprogramming adult skin cells to pluripotential precursors. Yamanaka developed the method as an alternative to embryonic stem cells, thus circumventing an approach in which embryos would be destroyed.In May 2010, Yamanaka was given Doctor of Science honorary degree by Mount Sinai School of Medicine.[22]In September 2010, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for his work on biology and stem cells.[23]Yamanaka has been listed as one of the 15 Asian Scientists To Watch by Asian Scientist magazine on May 15, 2011.[24][25] In June 2011, he was awarded the inaugural McEwen Award for Innovation; he shared the $100,000 prize with Kazutoshi Takahashi, who was the lead author on the paper describing the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.[26]In June 2012, he was awarded the Millennium Technology Prize for his work in stem cells.[27] He shared the 1.2 million euro prize with Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. In October 2012, he and fellow stem cell researcher John Gurdon were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.[28]2007 \u2013 Osaka Science Prize[29]2007 \u2013 Inoue Prize for Science[citation needed]2007 \u2013 Asahi Prize2007 \u2013 Meyenburg Cancer Research Award[30][31]2008 \u2013 Yamazaki-Teiichi Prize in Biological Science & Technology2008 \u2013 Robert Koch Prize2008 \u2013 Medals of Honor (Japan) (with purple ribbon)2008 \u2013 Shaw Prize in Life Science & Medicine[32][33][34]2008 \u2013 Sankyo Takamine Memorial Award[35]2008 \u2013 Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California2008 - Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36]2009 \u2013 Lewis S.

His research is in the area of oncogenes and the genetic basis of human cancer.[2][3][4]Robert Weinberg is also affiliated with the Broad Institute and is a founding member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.[5] Weinberg and Eric Lander, a colleague at M.I.T., are co-founders of Verastem, a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing drugs to treat cancer by targeting cancer stem cells.[6]Career[edit]Weinberg earned SB in Biology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964 and PhD in biology from the same institute in 1969. He was an instructor in biology at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama (1965\u20131966), and a postdoc in Ernest Winocour's lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science (1969\u20131970) and in Renato Dulbecco's lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (1970\u20131972). He joined MIT in 1972.[7]Research[edit]He is best known for his discoveries of the first human oncogene Ras and the first tumor suppressor gene Rb[8]p.\u00a0371-381, which is partially documented in Natalie Angier\u2032s book, Natural Obsessions, about her year spent in Weinberg's lab.In the late 20th century, advances in genetics led to the discovery of over one hundred cancer cell types. Cancer cells were noted for their bewildering diversity. It was hard to identify the principles that cancers had in common.He and Douglas Hanahan wrote the seminal paper The Hallmarks of Cancer, published in January 2000,[9] that gave the six requirements for one renegade cell to cause a deadly cancer:[8] In 2011, they published an updated review article entitled Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.[10]SummaryCapabilitySimple analogySelf-sufficiency in growth signalsaccelerator pedal stuck onInsensitivity to anti-growth signalsbrakes don't workEvading apoptosiswon't die when the body normally would kill the defective cellLimitless replicative potentialinfinite generations of descendantsSustained angiogenesisasking the body to give it a blood supplyTissue invasion and metastasismigrating and spreading to other organs and tissuesWeinberg is well known for both his cancer research[11] and for his mentorship of many eminent scientists, including Tyler Jacks, William C. Hahn, Clifford Tabin and Cornelia Bargmann. He is currently studying cancer cell metastasis.[12]He is also the author of the textbook The Biology of Cancer[1] published by Garland Science, as well as two important accounts intended for a wider audience: One Renegade Cell: How Cancer Begins (1999) (Science Masters Series); and Racing to the Beginning of the Road: The Search for the Origin of Cancer (1996).As of 2021[update], Weinberg has an h-index of 209 according to Google Scholar.[13]Awards and honors[edit]In 1985, Weinberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[14] Weinberg won the National Medal of Science and the Keio Medical Science Prize in 1997. In 1999, he received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in recognition of his valuable and pioneering contributions in the field of Biomedical Sciences and for his productive trajectory related to the genetic and molecular basis of neoplastic disease.[15] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2000.[16] He obtained the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 2004 (shared with Roger Y. Tsien), and he is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. In 2007 he received an honorary doctorate degree in commemoration of Linnaeus from Uppsala University. He is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences since 1992.[17]In 2009 he was presented the Hope Funds Award in Basic Research.[18] In 2013 he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work [19] and in 2021 he received the Japan Prize.[20]Retractions[edit]To this day Weinberg has had five research papers retracted where he is listed as a co-author. The retractions include one paper in Cell, one in Cancer Cell, two in Genes & Development and one in Cancer Research.[21][22][23][24]The reasons given for the retraction of one paper (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.04) include: Falsification/Fabrication of Data and Manipulation of Results.See also[edit]Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies (2015 PBS film)History of cancerHistory of cancer chemotherapyThe Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of CancerReferences[edit]^ a b Weinberg, Robert (2007).

Sawyers (born 1959) is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator who holds the Marie-Jos\u00e9e and Henry R. Kravis Chair of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program (HOPP) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). HOPP is a program created in 2006 that comprises researchers from many disciplines to bridge clinical and laboratory discoveries.[2]Career[edit]Sawyers received a BA from Princeton University in 1981 and an MD from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1985,[3] followed by an internal medicine residency at the University of California, San Francisco.[4] He became a HHMI investigator in 2002 while working at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center.[5]Sawyers works on molecularly targeted cancer drugs, with a focus on developing a new generation of treatment options for patients. He shared the 2009 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award with Brian J. Druker and Nicholas Lydon,[6] for the development of the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and the second-generation ABL inhibitor dasatinib to overcome imatinib resistance. He also co-discovered the antiandrogen drugs enzalutamide, approved by the FDA in 2012, and apalutamide[7] approved in 2019, both for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.[8]Sawyers' cancer research is discussed in the second episode of Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies.Significant positions[edit]Sawyers served as president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) in 2007[9] and of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in 2012.[10] He was also appointed to the National Cancer Advisory Board by President Obama in 2012,[11] and has served on the Board of Directors of Novartis since 2013.[12]He was a founding co-editor of the Annual Review of Cancer Biology in 2017,[13] serving until 2021.[14]Memberships[edit]National Academy of SciencesNational Academy of MedicineAmerican Academy of Arts and SciencesAwards[edit]Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award (2001)[15]David A.

Eric Lander is founding director emeritus of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.[5]Lander served as the 11th director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Science Advisor to the President in Joe Biden's presidential Cabinet.[6][1][7][8] In response to allegations that he had engaged in bullying and abusive conduct, Lander apologized and resigned from the Biden Administration effective February 18, 2022.[9][10]Early life and education[edit]Lander was born in Brooklyn, New York City,[11] to Jewish parents,[12] the son of Rhoda G. Lander, a social studies teacher, and Harold Lander, an attorney.[13] He was captain of the math team at Stuyvesant High School,[14] graduating in 1974 as valedictorian and an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist for the U.S.[15] At age 17, he wrote a paper on quasiperfect numbers for which he won the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.[15]After graduating from Stuyvesant High School as valedictorian in 1974, Lander graduated from Princeton University in 1978 as valedictorian and with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics.[15][16] He completed his senior thesis, On the structure of projective modules, under John Coleman Moore's supervision.[17] He then moved to the University of Oxford where he was a Rhodes Scholar and student of Wolfson College, Oxford.[18] He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by the University of Oxford in 1980 with a thesis on algebraic coding theory and symmetric block designs supervised by Peter Cameron.[19]Career[edit]During his career, Lander has worked on human genetic variation, human population history, genome evolution, non-coding RNAs, three-dimensional folding of the human genome and genome-wide association studies to discover the genes essential for biological processes using CRISPR-based editing.Early mathematical career[edit]As a mathematician, Lander studied combinatorics and applications of representation theory to coding theory. He enjoyed mathematics but did not wish to spend his life in such a monastic career.[20] Unsure what to do next, he took a job teaching managerial economics at Harvard Business School.  At the suggestion of his brother, developmental biologist Arthur Lander, he started to look at neurobiology, saying at the time, because there's a lot of information in the brain.[21] To understand mathematical neurobiology, he felt he had to study cellular neurobiology; this, in turn, led to studying microbiology and eventually genetics. When I finally feel I have learned genetics, I should get back to these other problems. But I'm still trying to get the genetics right, Lander said.Lander later became acquainted with David Botstein, a geneticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Botstein was working on a way to unravel how subtle differences in complex genetic systems can become disorders such as cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, and even obesity. The two collaborated to develop a computer algorithm to analyze the maps of genes.[20] In 1986 Lander joined the Whitehead Institute and became an assistant professor at MIT. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1987. In 1990, he founded the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (WICGR). The WICGR became one of the world's leading centers of genome research, and under Lander's leadership made great progress in developing new methods of analyzing mammalian genomes. It also made important breakthroughs in applying this information to the study of human genetic variation and formed the basis for the foundation of the Broad Institute\u2014a transformation Lander spearheaded. Contributions to genomics[edit]Two main groups attempted to sequence the human genome. The first was the Human Genome Project, a loosely organized, publicly funded effort that intended to publish the information it obtained freely and without restrictions. Many research groups from countries all over the world were involved in this effort. The second was undertaken by Celera Genomics, which intended to patent the information obtained and charge subscriptions for use of the sequence data. Established first, the Human Genome Project moved slowly in the early phases as the Department of Energy's role was unclear and sequencing technology was in its infancy. Officially, the Human Genome Project had an eight-year head start before Celera entered the race, though discussions for the Human Genome Project began fourteen years before Celera announced their own project.[22][23] Because the Human Genome Project was a $3 billion publicly funded venture,[22] the consortia raced to enter as much of the human genome into the public domain as quickly as possible once Celera began work in 1998. This was a change of strategy for the Human Genome Project, because many scientists at the time wanted to establish a more complete copy of the genome, not simply publish the many fragments individually. Lander aggressively pressured Human Genome Project scientists to work longer and faster to publish genome fragments before Celera.[24] Lander himself is now listed on 73 patents and patent applications related to genomics.[25]In February 2001, both the Human Genome Project and Celera published drafts of the human genome in the scientific journals Nature[26] and Science,[27] respectively. In the Human Genome Project's Nature publication, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Center for Genome Research, was listed first, with Lander listed as the first named author.[26][28]Leveraging Celera's sequencing and analysis techniques, the Whitehead Institute also made a contribution to the sequencing of the mouse genome,[29] an important step in fully understanding the molecular biology of mice, which are often used as model organisms in studies of everything from human diseases to embryonic development. The WICGR has since sequenced the genomes of Ciona savignyi (sea squirt),[30] the pufferfish,[31] the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa,[32] and multiple relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[33] one of the most studied yeasts. The Ciona savignyi genome provides a good system for exploring the evolutionary origins of all vertebrates. Pufferfish have smaller-sized genomes than other vertebrates; as a result, their genomes are mini models for vertebrates. The sequencing of the yeasts related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae will facilitate the identification of key gene regulatory elements, some of which may be common to all eukaryotes (including both plant and animal kingdoms).Lander was the founding editor of the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics.[34] He remained editor till 2004.Beyond genomics[edit]Sequence data is a list of bases found in a given stretch of DNA. Its value lies in the discoveries and new technologies it allows. For Lander, one of these applications is the study of disease. Lander is the founder and director of the Broad Institute, a collaboration between MIT, Harvard, the Whitehead Institute, and affiliated hospitals. Its goal is to create tools for genome medicine and make them broadly available to the scientific community in order to apply these tools to propel the understanding and treatment of disease. To this end, they are studying the variation in the human genome and have led an international effort that has assembled a library of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). These act as markers or signposts in the genome, allowing the identification of disease susceptibility genes. They hope to construct a map of the human genome using blocks of these SNP called linkage disequilibrium (LD). This map will be of significant help in medical genetics by allowing researchers to link a given condition to a given gene or set of genes using the LD as a marker. This will allow for improved diagnostic procedures. Lander and his colleagues are hoping the LD map will allow them to test the Common Disease-Common Variant hypothesis that states that many common diseases may be caused by a small number of common alleles. For example, 50% of the variance in susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease is explained by the common allele ApoE4. Lander's group has recently discovered an important association that accounts for a large proportion of the population's risk for adult-onset diabetes.Lander's most important work[35] may be his development of a molecular taxonomy for cancers.[36] The cancers are grouped according to gene expression and information such as their response to chemotherapy. The division of cancers into homogeneous subgroups will increase understanding of these cancers' molecular origins and help devise more effective therapies. Lander's group has also identified a new type of leukemia, MLL, and a gene that may serve as a target for a new drug.Teaching[edit]For several years, Lander has co-taught MIT's required undergraduate introductory biology course (7.012) with Robert Weinberg. Since 2013 he has also taught two online courses, Quantitative Biology Workshop and 7.00x Introduction to Biology \u2013 The Secret of Life via the EdX platform by working with the MITx Bio group.[37]Translational ventures[edit]Lander is a founding advisor of Foundation Medicine, a company that aims to bring comprehensive cancer genomic analysis to routine clinical care.[38] He is also a co-founder of Verastem, a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing drugs to treat cancer by targeting cancer stem cells.[39]Forensic science and criminal justice[edit]In 1989, Lander provided expert testimony in the New York criminal case People v. Castro. He showed that the then-current method of interpreting DNA evidence was liable to give false positive matches, implicating innocent defendants.[40][41][42] Two of the defense attorneys in that case, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, went on to found the Innocence Project, an organization that uses DNA analysis to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. Lander is a member of the Innocence Project's board of directors.[43]Science Advisor to the President[edit]Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Lander as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, June 2021In January 2021, President-elect Joe Biden nominated Lander as Science Advisor to the President and announced that he would elevate the position to a Cabinet-level post.[6] In January 2021, 500 female scientists published an editorial in Scientific American to consider naming someone else to the position, because he was well known within the scientific community for offending women.[44]His nomination had been held up possibly due to requests for clarification about his having attended two gatherings where Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy large-scale donor to science who was also a convicted sex offender, was present.[45] On April 29, a confirmation hearing was held in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.[46][47] On May 20, the committee voted to report favorably on the nomination, with five Republican senators voting against.[48] On May 28, 2021, before a Memorial Day recess, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote by the full Senate. Lander was sworn in as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy on June 2, 2021. He took his oath using a rare 1492 copy of the Pirkei Avot.[49]On February 7, 2022, Politico reported on a White House investigation in which fourteen current and former Office of Science and Technology Policy staffers accused Lander on February 4 of having bullied and demeaned his subordinates.[50] Lander admitted to the behavior and issued an apology to staff on February 4, his apology includes, I am devastated that I caused hurt to past and present colleagues by the way in which I have spoken to them... I believe it is not possible to continue effectively in my role, and the work of this office is far too important to be hindered.[51] He later resigned on February 7.[52][53]Since 2023, Eric Lander has returned to his tenured professor positions at MIT and Harvard as well as Broad as a Core Institute Member and Founding Director Emeritus. He served as president and founding director from Broad's inception until 2021.Recognition and service[edit]In 1999, Lander received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[54]In 2004, Lander was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of our time for his work on the Human Genome Project. He has appeared in numerous PBS documentaries about genetics. He was ranked #2 on the MIT150 list of MIT's innovators and ideas.[55]In December 2008, Lander and Harold E. Varmus were named co-chairs of the Obama administration's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. In 2012 he received the Dan David Prize.[56]Lander is a member of the advisory board to the USA Science and Engineering Festival.[57]In 2013, Lander was awarded the first Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[58][59] In 2016, Semantic Scholar AI program ranked him #1 on its list of most influential biomedical researchers.[60]In 2016, he received the Award for Excellence in Molecular Diagnostics from the Association for Molecular Pathology.[61]In 2017, Lander received an honoris causa doctorate from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain.[62] Also in 2017, he received the William Allan Award from the American Society of Human Genetics.[63]In 2019, he served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize. In 2020, Pope Francis appointed him a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science.[64] In 2021, Lander, who holds many patents, disclosed ownership of assets worth more than $45 million.[65]References[edit]^ a b Facher, Lev (February 1, 2021).

These findings helped lead to development of the first clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor, bevacizumab (Avastin), which prevents the growth of new blood vessels into a solid tumor and which has become part of standard treatment for a variety of cancers.[citation needed] Ferrara's work led also to the development of ranibizumab (Lucentis), a drug that is highly effective at preventing vision loss in intraocular neovascular disorders.[citation needed]Education[edit]Ferrara received his medical degree from the University of Catania, Italy, in 1981, and joined Genentech in 1988. He did his postdoctoral research at University of California, San Francisco.[2]Current research[edit]At UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, Ferrara, a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2006, serves as Senior Deputy Director for Basic Science and is a Distinguished Professor of Pathology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine, where he will continue cancer drug research targeting angiogenesis.[citation needed] He is presently focusing on investigating mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis alternative to VEGF, in particular the role of factors produced by myeloid cells and fibroblasts in mediating resistance to VEGF inhibitors.[citation needed]Selected honors and awards[edit]For his VEGF discovery, he won a Lasker Award in 2010.[3] In 2013, he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work.[4] He has received numerous other awards, including the General Motors Cancer Research Award (2006), the ASCO Science of Oncology Award (2007), the Pezcoller Foundation/AACR International Award (2009), the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research (2011), and The Economist's Innovation Award for bioscience in 2012.[citation needed] Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Lefoulon-Delalande in 2005.[5]In September 2014, Ferrara was awarded the Ant\u00f3nio Champalimaud Vision Award, awarded by the Champalimaud Foundation.[6]2023, Keio Medical Science Prize.[7]References[edit]^ Napoleone Ferrara, MD: Senior Deputy Director, Basic Science; Distinguished Professor of Pathology.

He is known for his work on quantum computation, in particular for devising Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring exponentially faster than the best currently-known algorithm running on a classical computer.Early life and education[edit]Shor was born in New York City to Joan Bopp Shor and S. W. Williston Shor.[10][11] He grew up in Washington, D.C. and Mill Valley, California.[10] While attending Tamalpais High School, he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad.[12] After graduation that year, he won a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad in Yugoslavia (the U.S. team achieved the most points per country that year).[13][14] He received his B.S. in Mathematics in 1981 for undergraduate work at Caltech,[15] and was a Putnam Fellow in 1978. He earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics from MIT in 1985.[16] His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton, and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.Career[edit]After being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey. It was there he developed Shor's algorithm. This development was inspired by Simon's problem, where he first solved the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and,Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There\u2019s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring.[17]Due to their similarity as HSP problems, Shor discovered a related factoring problem (Shor's algorithm) that same week for which he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998[18][19] and the G\u00f6del Prize in 1999.[20] In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.[21] In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.[22]Shor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT. He also is affiliated with CSAIL and the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP).[citation needed]He received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.[15]On October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23][24] He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 for contributions to quantum-computing, information theory, and randomized algorithms.[25] He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002.[26] In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to quantum computation.[27]In an interview published in Nature on October 30, 2020, Shor said that he considers post-quantum cryptography to be a solution to the quantum threat, although a lot of engineering effort is required to switch from vulnerable algorithms.[28]Along with three others, Shor was awarded the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for foundational work in the field of quantum information.[9]See also[edit]Entanglement-assisted classical capacityKeller's conjectureStabilizer codeQuantum capacityNotes[edit]^ The Mathematical Association of America's William Lowell Putnam Competition.

Robert HorvitzCornelia Isabella Cori Bargmann (born January 1, 1961)[1] is an American neurobiologist. She is known for her work on the genetic and neural circuit mechanisms of behavior using C. elegans, particularly the mechanisms of olfaction in the worm. She has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and had been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at UCSF and then Rockefeller University from 1995 to 2016. She was the Head of Science[2] at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative from 2016 to 2022.[3] In 2012 she was awarded the $1 million Kavli Prize, and in 2013 the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.Early life and education[edit]Bargmann was born in Virginia and grew up in Athens, Georgia.[4] Her parents are European immigrants.[5] She is one of four sisters, and the daughter of Rolf Bargmann, a statistician and computer scientist at the University of Georgia.[6] She grew up playing the piano and was exposed to literature and education from a very young age. She described her family as \u201cfrighteningly well educated\u201d.[7] She was inspired to study science because her older sister attended medical school. She also says that growing up in the space era fostered her love for science.[5]She completed undergraduate studies at the University of Georgia in 1981, with a degree in biochemistry. While at UGA she grew her lab experience by working in Wyatt Anderson's biology lab and then in Sidney Kushner's genetics lab.[7] She completed graduate school from MIT with a Ph.D. in the department of Biology in 1987 in the lab of Robert Weinberg. She examined the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis, and helped identify the role of Ras in bladder cancer. She wrote her thesis on  neu, a non-Ras oncogene. Although the relevance of her research was doubted at the time, it later led to significant treatments in breast cancer.[7]Career and research[edit]Bargmann completed a postdoc with H. Robert Horvitz at MIT, working on molecular biology mechanisms of neuroscience. She began working on chemosensory behavior in C. elegans, and achieved several breakthroughs, demonstrating, among other things, that nematodes have a sense of smell.[7][8]Bargmann accepted a faculty position at UCSF in the department of Anatomy in 1995. She was ultimately promoted from assistant professor to professor in 1998, and served as vice chair of the department from 1999 to 2000.[7]She continued her studies of worm behavior and neural control, focusing on olfaction at the molecular level. She looked for genes similar to those found by Richard Axel and Linda Buck to be the basis of smell and taste, and found those genes in the recently sequenced genome of C elegans. Her work led to discoveries of the mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as feeding behaviors.[7][9] The work has continued to lead to a deeper understanding of the brain, sensory abilities, and neuronal development. Bargmann also identified SYG-1, a matchmaker molecule\u2014a molecule that directs neurons to form connections with each other during development.[10][11][12][13]In 2004, Bargmann moved to Rockefeller University.[11] She says that the reason for the move is that she wanted more flexibility to focus on research.[5] She served as an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute until 2016 before she took the President of CZI. Bargmann's lab uses a relatively simple organism, the nematode C. elegans, and its extremely sensitive sense of smell to study how genes regulate neuronal development, function, and behavior. Her work has been recognized with numerous awards including election to the National Academy of Sciences. She also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2012.Bargmann's research was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1995 to 2016.[14] She was the co-chair of the BRAIN initiative and the Head of Science for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.[3] She won the Breakthrough prize in Life Sciences in 2013.[5]Bargmann is married to fellow olfactory scientist Richard Axel, a Nobel laureate. Previously, she had been married to Michael J. Finney, who also completed graduate studies at MIT and is now a Director at Sage Science, Inc.For a vivid portrait of Bargmann as a young scientist working in Weinberg's lab, see Natalie Angier's book Natural Obsessions: The Search for the Oncogene.Notable papers[edit]Shen, Kang; Bargmann, Cornelia I.

In 1985 she joined Harold Varmus's lab at the University of California, San Francisco. Since 1990 she has had a faculty position at the Rockefeller University. In 2011, de Lange received the Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science.[2]  In 2013 she won a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, worth $3 million, for her research on telomeres.[3]In 2000 she became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[4]Career[edit]Titia de Lange attended the University of Amsterdam where she received her bachelor's and master's degree in biochemistry.[5] She also earned her Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam while working at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.[5] In 1985, she accepted a postdoctoral fellowship position at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1990, de Lange started her own lab at Rockefeller University.[5] She is currently the Leon Hess Professor as well as the Director of the Anderson Center for Cancer Research at Rockefeller University.[6] She won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2013 for her research on telomeres, illuminating how they protect chromosome ends and their role in genome instability in cancer by mapping the complex of molecules that loops the strands together and protects them. In addition to making headway in revealing the structure of DNA, her research has implications for the understanding of aging and cancer.[7]Research[edit]Titia de Lange originally wanted to study chemistry after finishing high school in the Netherlands but the lack of women in chemistry among students and teachers alike convinced her to study biology with a biochemistry track instead.[5] In her time at the University of Amsterdam she worked for mentor Richard Flavell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she completed her master's thesis.[5] Her thesis focused on DNA translocation in \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia, a very rare form of thalassemia.[8] Her research identified a patient with \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia with a DNA translocation that caused the inactivation of the \u03b2-Globin gene.[8] de Lange spoke highly of the lab saying That was where I first saw how science is really done. \u2026 It was a very vibrant, competitive, international lab. It was a lot of fun, so that made me stay in science.[5]De Lange started to gain interest in telomeres while earning her Ph.D. at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.[5] Telomeres gradually became the major focus of her research. After receiving her Ph.D. in 1985, de Lange completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco in Harold Varmus's Lab from 1985 to 1990.[5] While working at UCSF, de Lange continued her work on telomeres. de Lange discovered that sperm cells have telomeres that are several kilobase pairs longer than somatic cells.[9] She also found that tumor cells also have significantly shorter telomeres.[9] This research was significant in establishing the role of telomeres in both aging as well as cancer. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes that function as protective elements from improper DNA repair.[10] The nucleotide sequence of telomeres is TTAGGG.[10] As a person ages telomeres are gradually shortened with each round of DNA replication, as not all of the DNA sequence is fully replicated.[10] Chromosome ends are threatened by various pathways, DNA-damage signaling pathways involving ATM or ATR kinase as well as double-strand break repair pathways, Non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair.[11]At Rockefeller University her research focused on identifying proteins associated with telomeres and their role in protecting telomeres from processes of DNA repair.[5] In her first several years she dedicated a long amount of time and resources to identifying the major protein components of human telomeres.[5] In 1995, she identified and purified the Telomeric-repeat binding factor protein 1 (TRF1).[12] With the assistance of Bas van Steensel, de Lange conducted various studies on proteins associated with telomeres.[5] She found that TRF1 is crucial in the regulation of the length of telomeres.[13] In her research, she proposed that TRF1 inhibits the action of telomerase.[13] Telomerase is an RNA dependent DNA polymerase that can elongate telomeres and is essential in the maintenance of telomeric DNA.[9][12] Telomerase can counteract the shortening of telomeres, which occurs during the DNA replication process.[14] She and her co-investigators, Bas van Steensel and Agata Smogorzewska, also discovered the protein TRF2  and found that it prevents the end-to-end fusing of telomeres, in addition to other functions.[15]One of de Lange's major discoveries was the discovery of the t-loop structure of telomeres in her collaboration with Jack Griffith.[16] This was shown through electron microscopy demonstrating that linear telomeric DNA can be remodeled by TRF2 into duplex loops (t loops).[14] This architectural change allows for TRF2 to sequester the ends of telomeres, which function to safeguard telomeres by covering overhanging single strands of DNA.[14] This mechanism protects against the improper activation of DNA damage checkpoints by natural chromosome ends.[14] Previous research had observed that in addition to protecting the ends of chromosomes, telomeric complexes also allow cells to distinguish random DNA breaks and natural chromosome ends.[14]In 2005, de Lange came to the crucial realization that six telomeric proteins form a dynamic protein complex, that she named shelterin, named for its function of protecting chromosome ends.[17] The six shelterin subunits are: TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap1, TPP1, and POT1.[17] Shelterin subunits are not the only proteins that associate with telomeres but they differ from other proteins by meeting the criteria of not accumulating in areas beside chromosome ends, their function is limited to telomeres, and they are present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle.[17] Shelterin allows for telomeres to be essentially hidden from the DNA damage surveillance, without its safeguarding chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways where the telomeres would be mistaken for damaged DNA.[17]Titia de Lange's research has proven to be invaluable in the area of telomere research and has led to greater understanding for cancer development as well as genome maintenance.[5] Her research has catalyzed more research into the important role of telomeres in tumor development.Awards[edit]De Lange is the recipient of several awards including the 2001 Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research, the 2008 Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center Prize, the 2010 AACR Clowes Memorial Award, the 2011 Vanderbilt Prize in Biomedical Science, the 2011 Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science, the 2013 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the 2014 Gairdner International Award, and the 2017 Rosenstiel Award.[6][8]She is an elected member of multiple organizations including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, The European Molecular Biology Organization, and the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences.[6] In 2022 she was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.[18]References[edit]^ De Lange, Titia (October 10, 2018).

Cantley (born February 20, 1949) is an American cell biologist and biochemist who has made significant advances to the understanding of cancer metabolism. Among his most notable contributions are the discovery and study of the enzyme PI-3-kinase, now known to be important to understanding cancer and diabetes mellitus.[1][2] He is currently Meyer Director and Professor of Cancer Biology at the  Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.  He was formerly a professor in the Departments of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, he was elected Chairman of the Board for the Hope Funds for Cancer Research.Biography[edit]Cantley grew up in West Virginia, remaining there at Wesleyan College where he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry in 1971.  Cantley obtained his PhD at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked with Gordon Hammes on enzyme kinetics, using FRET to study enzyme conformational changes.  In 1975 he moved to Harvard University for a postdoctoral fellowship under Guido Guidotti, where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of ATP, vanadate, acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis.  In 1978 Cantley became assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard, being promoted to associate professor in 1981.  In 1985, he became a full professor in physiology at Tufts University School of Medicine.  In 1985 Cantley and colleagues Malcolm Whitman, David Kaplan, Tom Roberts, and Brian Schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K).  In 1992, Cantley moved to Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Cell Biology and the Director of the Division of Signal Transduction at the former Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center).  In 2003, Cantley became a founding member of the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School.  In 2007, Cantley also became the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He joined the faculty of Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in 2012.[1][2][3][4] Dr. Cantley was elected the Chairman of the Board of the Hope Funds for Cancer Research in 2016.[5]Cantley is married to Vicki Sato, herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a professor at Harvard University in both the Business and Medical Schools.Research[edit]Discovery of PI-3-kinase and PtdIns(3,4)P2[1][2][6][edit]In a series of studies spanning several years, Cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle T oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase,[7] that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the 3' position on the inositol ring,[8] and that this phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) is activated by growth factors to produce novel 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, in particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3[9] that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils.[10]  In subsequent years Cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of PI-3-kinase by growth factor receptors.  Specifically, they discovered that the catalytic subunit p110 dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p85,[11] and that the SH2 domain of p85 specifically recognized phosphotyrosines[12] on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pY-X-X-M motif.[13][14]The Cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of PI-3-kinase.  They discovered that the Pleckstrin Homology domain of AKT binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (and PtdIns(3,4)P2) and that this binding is critical for activation of AKT catalytic activity.[15][16]  They further demonstrated that tuberin/TSC2 is a critical substrate of AKT,[17] and together with the laboratory of John Blenis they discovered that AKT phosphorylation of tuberin/TSC2 is required for activation of mTOR TORC1 kinase activity[18] via regulation of the small GTPase rheb.[19]  The Cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified LKB1 as a regulator of AMPK that also serves to regulate TORC1.[20][21]For the discovery of PI-3-Kinase and its role in cancer metabolism, Cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the world's richest academic prize for medicine and biology. The prize, which carries a $3 million cash award, recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life.[22] The fundamental and far-reaching nature of the discovery of PI-3-kinase, together with Cantley's role in mapping the upstream regulation of PI-3-kinase and the downstream signaling pathways, have led to speculation that Cantley is a likely candidate for the Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology.[23]  The growing evidence for a primary role for PI-3-kinase in cancer[24][25] and its critical role in insulin signaling[26] have served to strengthen the significance of this fundamentally important discovery.The first drug targeting the PI-3-kinase pathway as a treatment for cancer - Idelalisib (PI3K Delta inhibitor) - was approved by the FDA as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in July 2014.[27] Other drugs are currently in clinical development.Use of Oriented Peptide Libraries to determine phosphopeptide binding specificity and protein kinase substrate specificity[edit]In 1994, the Cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains (initially SH2 domains).[13]Subsequently, the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides.[28]  This approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of Ser/Thr kinases and phospho-Ser/Thr binding domains.[29]  This approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases.  The kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website Scansite, allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein.[30][31]In later research, the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity.[32]  Modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale, kinome-wide determination of protein kinase specificity.[33]Discovery of PtdIns(5)P[edit]In 1997, the Cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type II PIP-kinases, instead of using PtdIns(4)P as a substrate, in fact required PtdIns(5)P as a substrate to produce PtdIns(4,5)P2.[34]  Further research demonstrated that PtdIns(5)P is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes.It is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides, the existence of four of them (PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) was discovered by Cantley and colleagues.[8][9][34][35]Role of metabolism in cancer[edit]The role of PI-3-kinase in anabolic signaling by insulin, IGF-1, and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer, especially in light of the discovery that the PIK3CA gene encoding PI-3-kinase is an oncogene.[36]In recent years Cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer.[37][38]  This discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the Warburg effect.  Cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the Warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis.[39]Role of PI-3-kinase in different cancers[edit]Cantley was part of the Stand Up to Cancer dream team that was brought together to investigate ways to target PI-3-kinase as a way to treat women's cancers, and he now leads a national effort targeting triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations.[40] Recent research found that high levels of Vitamin C halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors.[41] His lab also elucidated the role of Nrf2 in serine production in non-small cell lung cancer, with potential implications for pancreatic and other cancers as well.[42]Industrial activities[edit]Lewis C. Cantley has been involved in numerous companies.  Recent examples include the following:Co-founder of Petra Pharma (with Nathanael Gray)[43]Co-founder of Agios Pharmaceuticals (with Tak Mak and Craig B. Thompson)[44]Co-founder of Volastra Therapeutics (with Sam Bakhoum and Olivier Elemento)[45]Advisory Board of AVEO Pharmaceuticals [46]Advisory Board of TransMolecular, Inc.[47]Awards, honors and media appearances[edit]Cantley has received numerous awards and  honors, including:ASBMB Avanti Award for Lipid Research (1998)[48]Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1999)[49]Heinrich Wieland Prize for Lipid Research (2000)Elected to the National Academy of Sciences (2001) [1]Caledonian Prize from the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2002)[50]Pezcoller-AACR International Award for Cancer Research (2005)[51]Rolf Luft Award of the Karolinska Institute (2009)[52]Pasrow Prize for Cancer Research (2011)Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2013)Jacobaeus Prize for Diabetes Research, from the Karolinska Institute (2013) [53]Elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (2014)[54]AACR Princess Takamatsu Memorial Lectureship (2015) [55]Ross Prize in Molecular Medicine (2015) [56]Canada Gairdner International Award (2015) [57]Elected to European life sciences academy EMBO (2015) [58]The Association of American Cancer Institutes Distinguished Scientist Award (2015) [59]Thomson Reuter's The World's Most Influential Scientific Minds 2015.[60]The Wolf Prize in Medicine (2016) [61]The Hope Funds Award of Excellence in Basic Science (2016)Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (2019) [62]He appeared in the 60 Minutes program Is sugar toxic?.[63]References[edit]^ a b c d Bradley D (March 2004).

He was the director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University[4][5][6][7] from 2003 to 2013, where he remains an Anthony B. Evnin Professor of Genomics.Education[edit]Botstein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959, and Harvard University in 1963. He started his Ph.D. work under Maurice Sanford Fox at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then moved and received a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1967 for work on P22 phage.[8]Career[edit]Botstein taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he became a professor of genetics. Botstein joined Genentech, Inc. in 1987 as vice president \u2013 science. In 1990, he became chairman of the Department of Genetics at Stanford University. Botstein was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1981 and to the Institute of Medicine in 1993.Botstein is the director of the Integrated Science Program at Princeton University.[9]In 1980, Botstein and his colleagues Ray White, Mark Skolnick, and Ronald W. Davis proposed a method[10] for constructing a genetic linkage map using restriction fragment length polymorphisms that was used in subsequent years to identify several human disease genes including Huntington's and BRCA1.  Variations of this method were used in the mapping efforts that predated and enabled the sequencing phase of the Human Genome Project.In 1998, Botstein and his postdoctoral fellow Michael Eisen, together with graduate student Paul Spellman and colleague Patrick Brown, developed a statistical method and graphical interface that is widely used to interpret genomic data including microarray data.[11] This approach was refined and applied for diverse applications, including for a molecular classification of heterogenous tumors using gene expression. These efforts included work on discovery of tumor subtypes with Lou Staudt, Ash Alizadeh and Ronald Levy, yielding a refined  classification of diffuse large B cell lymphomas, and in painting the molecular portraits for refined classification of breast cancers with Anne-Lise B\u00f8rresen-Dale and Charles Perou.  He has subsequently worked on the creation of the influential Gene Ontology[12] with Michael Ashburner and Suzanna Lewis. He is one of the founding editors of the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell, along with Erkki Ruoslahti and Keith Yamamoto.[13]In 2013, Botstein was named chief scientific officer of Google's anti-aging health startup Calico.Awards[edit]Botstein has won the Eli Lilly and Company Award in Microbiology (1978), the Genetics Society of America Medal (1988, with Ira Herskowitz),[1] the Allan Award of the American Society of Human Genetics (1989, with Ray White), the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2003), the Albany Medical Center Prize (2010, with Eric Lander and Francis Collins) and the Dan David Prize in 2012. In 2013 he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work and in 2020 the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal of the Genetics Society of America.[14] In 2016, Semantic Scholar AI program included Botstein on its list of most top ten most influential biomedical researchers.[15]Personal[edit]Botstein is an alumnus of Camp Rising Sun. He is the brother of the conductor Leon Botstein.  Both of Botstein's parents were physicians.References[edit]^ a b Mahowald, A. (1988). Genetics society of america records, proceedings and reports.

He is a visiting professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer.[5] He has also proposed the use of entangled states and Bell's theorem for quantum key distribution[5] and is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[6]Early life and education[edit]Deutsch was born into a Jewish family in Haifa, Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. In London, David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (his parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood Broadway), followed by William Ellis School in Highgate (then a voluntary aided school in north London) before reading Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge and taking Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. He went on to Wolfson College, Oxford for his doctorate in theoretical physics[2] and wrote his thesis on quantum field theory in curved space-time[3][7] supervised by Dennis Sciama[1] and Philip Candelas.[2][8]Career and research[edit]His work on quantum algorithms began with a 1985 paper, later expanded in 1992 along with Richard Jozsa to produce the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm, one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm.[5] In his 1985 paper, he also suggests the use of entangled states and Bell's theorem for quantum key distribution.[5] In his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008, his contributions were described as:[4][having] laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.Since 2012,[9] he has been working on constructor theory, an attempt at generalizing the quantum theory of computation to cover not just computation but all physical processes.[10][11] Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled Constructor theory of information, that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.[12][13]The Fabric of Reality[edit]Main article: The Fabric of RealityIn his 1997 book The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch details his Theory of Everything. It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among multiversal, computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat (weakly) emergentist rather than reductive. There are four strands to his theory:Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, the first and most important of the four strands.Karl Popper's epistemology, especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a realist (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.Alan Turing's theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch's Turing principle, in which the Universal Turing machine is replaced by Deutsch's universal quantum computer. (The theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.)Richard Dawkins' refinement of Darwinian evolutionary theory and the modern evolutionary synthesis, especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the epistemological strand).Invariants[edit]In a 2009 TED talk, Deutsch expounded a criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions].[14]A bad explanation is easy to vary.[14]:\u200aminute 11:22\u200aThe search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress[14]:\u200aminute 15:05\u200aThat the truth consists of hard-to-vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world.[14]:\u200aminute 16:15\u200aInvariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality had long been part of philosophy of science: for example, Friedel Weinert's book The Scientist as Philosopher (2004) noted the presence of the theme in many writings from around 1900 onward, such as works by Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1902), Ernst Cassirer (1920), Max Born (1949 and 1953), Paul Dirac (1958), Olivier Costa de Beauregard (1966), Eugene Wigner (1967), Lawrence Sklar (1974), Michael Friedman (1983), John D. Norton (1992), Nicholas Maxwell (1993), Alan Cook (1994), Alistair Cameron Crombie (1994), Margaret Morrison (1995), Richard Feynman (1997), Robert Nozick (2001), and Tim Maudlin (2002).[15]The Beginning of Infinity[edit]Main article: The Beginning of InfinityDeutsch's second book, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World, was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, he views the European Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries as near the beginning of a potentially unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of knowledge, memes, and how and why creativity evolved in humans.Awards and honours[edit]The Fabric of Reality was shortlisted for the Rhone-Poulenc science book award in 1998.[16] Deutsch was awarded the Dirac Prize of the Institute of Physics in 1998,[17] and the Edge of Computation Science Prize in 2005.[17][18] In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).[19] Deutsch is linked to Paul Dirac through his doctoral advisor Dennis Sciama, whose doctoral advisor was Dirac. Deutsch was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008.[4] In 2020 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Cybernetics Society.[20] In 2018, he received the Micius Quantum Prize. In 2021, he was awarded the Isaac Newton Medal and Prize.[21]On 22\u00a0September 2022, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (sharing it with 3 others).[22]Personal life[edit]Deutsch is a founding member of the parenting and educational method Taking Children Seriously.[23] Deutsch supported Brexit, with his advocacy regularly being quoted by the then government adviser, Dominic Cummings.[24]See also[edit]Deutsch gateWigner's friendQuantum cellular automatonQuantum mechanics of time travelReferences[edit]^ a b c David Deutsch at the Mathematics Genealogy Project^ a b c Deutsch, David Elieser (1978).
